            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://primevalwell.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Primeval Well</a> headlined an intimate show at the <a href="https://avantgardebar.myshopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Avant-Garde Bar</a> this past Saturday, February 21, 2026.</p>

<p>The show opened with <a href="https://www.lastingtale.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Gróa Willing</a>, a local act that plays a sort of minimal, acoustic-only black metal. It was nice. Trance-like. They did four songs, which were all a little samey, but I liked it for what it was.</p>
<p>Next up were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nirthal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Nirthal</a>, also local and billed as "King Diamond worship." I didn't care much for their stuff, but others in the audience enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Primeval Well played last. They were <strong>great</strong>. They played selections from their second LP, <a href="https://primevalwell.bandcamp.com/album/talkin-in-tongues-with-mountain-spirits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><em>Talkin' in Tongues with Mountain Spirits</em></a> (2021). My favourite tracks were "She Flies Undead" and "Where All Things are Forgotten."</p>

<p>Primeval Well's shtick is mixing black metal and bluegrass, which sounds like a really strange pairing, but they make it work. They engage with Appalachian folk spirituality so earnestly, it elevates their brand of atmospheric black metal. Full marks from me.</p>
<p>A special mention about <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/ryan-clackner-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Ryan Clackner</a>, the band's guitarist, vocalist, and main creative force. You get a pretty good idea how inventive and well developed his playing is from the albums, but seeing it live is something else. And a great singer to boot. What a beast.</p>]]></content:encoded>
