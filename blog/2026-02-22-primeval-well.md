[Primeval Well](https://primevalwell.bandcamp.com/) headlined an intimate show at the [Avant-Garde Bar](https://avantgardebar.myshopify.com/) this past Saturday, February 21, 2026.

The show opened with [Gróa Willing](https://www.lastingtale.ca/), a local act that plays a sort of minimal, acoustic-only black metal. It was nice. Trance-like. They did four songs, which were all a little samey, but I liked it for what it was.

Next up were [Nirthal](https://www.facebook.com/Nirthal), also local and billed as "King Diamond worship." I didn't care much for their stuff, but others in the audience enjoyed it.

Primeval Well played last. They were **great**. They played selections from their second LP, [*Talkin' in Tongues with Mountain Spirits*](https://primevalwell.bandcamp.com/album/talkin-in-tongues-with-mountain-spirits) (2021). My favourite tracks were "She Flies Undead" and "Where All Things are Forgotten."

Primeval Well's shtick is mixing black metal and bluegrass, which sounds like a really strange pairing, but they make it work. They engage with Appalachian folk spirituality so earnestly, it elevates their brand of atmospheric black metal. Full marks from me.

A special mention about [Ryan Clackner](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/ryan-clackner-feature), the band's guitarist, vocalist, and main creative force. You get a pretty good idea how inventive and well developed his playing is from the albums, but seeing it live is something else. And a great singer to boot. What a beast.
