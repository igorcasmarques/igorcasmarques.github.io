<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="express-entry">&quot;Express&quot; entry<a href="#express-entry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to &quot;Express&quot; entry" title="Direct link to &quot;Express&quot; entry">​</a></h2>
<p>In the span of a week in the spring of 2020, Vero and I went from hoping things would miraculously work out in the US to losing all hope to wholeheartedly deciding to go to Canada instead.</p>
<p>As soon as we had made this decision, Vero started reading every government webpage and blog post she could find about the immigration process. When she didn&#x27;t understand something, she&#x27;d pop the question in one of the Facebook groups that she&#x27;d joined and get an answer in minutes.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-94778c" id="user-content-fnref-1-94778c" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Thank you, beauty bias.</p>
<p>She would then relay what she&#x27;d learned to me.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="points">Points<a href="#points" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Points" title="Direct link to Points">​</a></h3>
<p>Vero told me that our safest best was entering the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Skilled Worker</a> program in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Express Entry</a> system. This process would require every last penny we had (and a little extra that I&#x27;d have to &quot;borrow&quot; indefinitely from my mother), but it made immigrating possible.</p>
<p>She also explained that people in the Express Entry pool were ranked using a point system, and that points were given according to criteria like age, family size, education, etc. Then, every so often, Express Entry would invite the top-ranked candidates to apply for permanent residence.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="all-or-nothing">All or nothing<a href="#all-or-nothing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to All or nothing" title="Direct link to All or nothing">​</a></h3>
<p>&quot;You know what&#x27;s the best part?,&quot; she teased me.</p>
<p>&quot;No, what&#x27;s the best part?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If we get an invitation to apply for permanent residence, we&#x27;re basically in. We just need to send our documents, do some medical exams, and wait for them to make sure everything we sent them is legit. The hard part is making the cut.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you imagine what a relief that would be? Permanent residence. But how hard is it for us to get enough points?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s... doable, but not easy.&quot;</p>
<p>Vero had been tracking the cut-off scores of past rounds of invitations.</p>
<p>&quot;Your PhD helps, our savings help, but we still need to get perfect marks in the English test,&quot; she explained. &quot;And we need to do it soon, because I think the cut-off scores are getting higher, and may soon be out of reach for us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So... we need to go all in, right now. Are you sure you wanna do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am,&quot; she replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I am too,&quot; I said, leaning on her confidence.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-tu-parles-français-nest-ce-pas--">« Tu parles français, n&#x27;est-ce pas ? »<a href="#-tu-parles-français-nest-ce-pas--" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to « Tu parles français, n&#x27;est-ce pas ? »" title="Direct link to « Tu parles français, n&#x27;est-ce pas ? »">​</a></h3>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s just one thing,&quot; she mentioned.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you get good marks on the French test, our profile will be much better ranked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t speak French. I picked up a few things when we went to <a href="/my-story/elias#paris">Paris</a>, but I really don&#x27;t speak French.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. But you can learn it. You have two months.&quot;</p>
<p>I trusted Vero and booked my <a href="https://apprendre.tv5monde.com/en/tcf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test de connaissance du français</em></a> (TCF) that same night, not knowing how to speak French.</p>
<p>I was done with work at UB, so I started using Duolingo and watching French shows and movies on Netflix for hours on end, every day.</p>
<p>Eight weeks later, between Independence Day and the <em>prise de la Bastille</em>, I drove 11 hours down to Raleigh, NC, whose <a href="https://www.afraleigh.org/page/1642293-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alliance française</a> was the only place close-ish to us that was offering the TCF in the middle of the pandemic.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="biding-our-time">Biding our time<a href="#biding-our-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Biding our time" title="Direct link to Biding our time">​</a></h2>
<p>When the results of our language proficiency tests came back, we were relieved. Vero and I got the scores we needed in English, and even though I didn&#x27;t do well in my oral interview in French, I got top marks in <em>compréhension écrite et orale</em>. This put us in the Express Entry safe zone.</p>
<p>We&#x27;d read that the typical Express Entry process took six months from submitting one&#x27;s profile to getting approved for permanent residence. We had four months left in the US, and a part of me hoped we&#x27;d get lucky and have our application processed faster than usual.</p>
<p>I just wanted to hop across the border and end the instability in our life.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="curitiba-again">Curitiba, again<a href="#curitiba-again" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Curitiba, again" title="Direct link to Curitiba, again">​</a></h2>
<p>After coming back from Raleigh, I spent the rest of the summer taking my sons on long walks around our neighbourhood. We especially liked getting cold treats at the 7-Eleven nearby and playing in <a href="https://www.amherst.ny.us/content/parks_detail.php?park_num=park_0021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dellwood Park</a>.</p>
<p>Soon, it became obvious that we wouldn&#x27;t be able to go straight from the US to Canada. We needed to go back to Curitiba, where we had a solid support system, and wait out the processing of our application there.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="last-month-in-the-us">Last month in the US<a href="#last-month-in-the-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Last month in the US" title="Direct link to Last month in the US">​</a></h3>
<p>A few days after we bought our flight tickets, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) invited us to apply for permanent residence.</p>
<p>We felt victorious, but there was no time to celebrate.</p>
<p>We spent our last month in the US selling or giving away our possessions. We could only fit so much in our four suitcases, and we prioritized clothing and items with sentimental value; everything else had to stay behind. We also ran around to gather some additional documents that IRCC was asking.</p>
<p>We didn&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;d take for Canada to accept our application, but we hoped our sojourn in Curitiba would be a short one.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-twa-hotel">The TWA Hotel<a href="#the-twa-hotel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The TWA Hotel" title="Direct link to The TWA Hotel">​</a></h3>
<p>When I researched flight tickets online, I realized that if we booked a flight from Buffalo-Curitiba on the same ticket, it would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very tiring</li>
<li>More expensive than booking Buffalo-JFK and JFK-Curitiba as separate tickets</li>
</ul>
<p>So I thought:</p>
<p><em>Why not do Buffalo-JFK on one day and just... take our time there? We can use the money we&#x27;d save from not buying a single ticket to stay at a hotel and fly to Brazil the next day.</em></p>
<p>We stayed at the recently renovated <a href="https://www.twahotel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TWA Hotel</a>, and it was magical. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Mrs._Maisel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em></a> magical. The retro architecture and decor, the red carpets, the rooftop infinity pool, the views of the runways, the clickety-clack of the split-flap display in the sunken lounge.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-94778c" id="user-content-fnref-2-94778c" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> Everything was awesome.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m still proud of that idea. Our family was in no rush to return to Brazil, so we were glad to exchange expediency for comfort and some memory-making. It turned a stressful move into a fun trip.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mixed-feelings">Mixed feelings<a href="#mixed-feelings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mixed feelings" title="Direct link to Mixed feelings">​</a></h3>
<p>Travelling in the pandemic was a pain, but we made it to Curitiba without any problems.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d forgotten how much I loved Curitiba and my old neighbourhood. It&#x27;s beautiful, convenient, and vibrant. I felt silly for believing that going back to Brazil was a punishment for failing. It wasn&#x27;t. Curitiba is an objectively better city to live in than most places in the US.</p>
<p>With one caveat: safety.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to be robbed or have their homes burglarized in Brazil. In fact, there was a break-in in our apartment complex the first week we were there, but super caught them on camera and called the police, who came to arrest them.</p>
<p>And a second caveat: good education is expensive.</p>
<p>We enrolled Samuel in a public school in a somewhat sketchy neighbourhood. Since classes were online due to the pandemic, we weren&#x27;t worry about his safety in school or the quality of education. But had we stayed in Curitiba long enough for the pandemic restrictions to be lifted, we would have had to transfer him to a private school.</p>
<p>Living in the US or Canada was really just a way for us to enable our children to grow up safely and with access to good education. In most other regards, I like living in Brazil better, and Vero feels most at home in Chile.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="job-worries">Job worries<a href="#job-worries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Job worries" title="Direct link to Job worries">​</a></h3>
<p>Our Canadian permanent residence application was stuck, and I accepted that we could be in Curitiba for a long time, so I spent the rest of 2020 looking for a job.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="job-counselling">Job counselling<a href="#job-counselling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Job counselling" title="Direct link to Job counselling">​</a></h4>
<p>The first thing I did was talk to an employment specialist at the city&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Agency.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d seen on TV how well employment agencies worked in Scandinavia. I thought that an employment agent would see my experience and potential, pull some strings, and find me a position in the hidden job market.</p>
<p>For better or worse, Brazil is not Sweden. The agent I talked to didn&#x27;t know what a doctorate was, was not impressed by the languages I spoke, said that I had no real skills, and insisted that I should be a cashier in a grocery store.</p>
<p>Not very helpful. I had to revive my <a href="/my-story/elias#year-4-ub">job application spreadsheet</a> and do the legwork myself.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translator-interview">Translator interview<a href="#translator-interview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Translator interview" title="Direct link to Translator interview">​</a></h4>
<p>I soon landed an interview for a trilingual translator of patents and technical diagrams. I did well in the interview and practical test, but the company ghosted me afterwards.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="music-professor-interview-1">Music professor interview 1<a href="#music-professor-interview-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Music professor interview 1" title="Direct link to Music professor interview 1">​</a></h4>
<p>Then, my beloved <a href="/my-story/from-curitiba-to-provo#belas">Belas</a>, which by then had been incorporated into a state university, posted an opening with a job description that fit my profile perfectly.</p>
<p>Curiously, the chairperson of the hiring committee was a UB alumnus like me, and a former student of <a href="http://www.david-felder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Felder</a>!</p>
<p>Everything worked in my favour, but I still didn&#x27;t get the job. Positions in Brazilian public institutions are vied for like contests, and I placed 2nd or 3rd—I don&#x27;t quite remember because there was a suspiciously large gap between the score of the winning candidate and everyone else&#x27;s.</p>

<p>In early 2021, a friend from UB who lived and worked in Chile told me that I was a great match for an opening at the <a href="https://www.uach.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universidad Austral de Chile</a> (UACh).</p>
<p>I applied, got an interview, and aced it.</p>
<p>Then I got a job offer.</p>
