<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="milestone">Milestone<a href="#milestone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Milestone" title="Direct link to Milestone">​</a></h2>
<p>Vero and I were born a month apart in 1988, so we&#x27;d both be turning 30 in 2018. For this special birthday, I wanted to give my wife two presents:</p>
<ul>
<li>An original song</li>
<li>A trip</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="song">Song<a href="#song" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Song" title="Direct link to Song">​</a></h3>
<p>After writing and practicing <a href="https://youtu.be/D7G-wQx1XPY?si=bFCJwgmIyFZf2sCc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Sin pies ni cabeza&quot;</a> for about two weeks, I recorded it in a single take in the basement studio of a good friend of mine. I then combed through our family&#x27;s external hard drives to make a montage with the videos we had of Vero to go along with the song.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m satisfied with the music video, even though the recording and my singing are somewhat rough around the edges. And I think Vero enjoyed it, too.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trip">Trip<a href="#trip" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Trip" title="Direct link to Trip">​</a></h3>
<p>Vero loves travelling so I wanted to plan a surprise trip for her birthday. I thought we should go to Canada, but just crossing the border and going to a place like <a href="https://www.visitniagaracanada.com/region/niagara-on-the-lake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niagara-on-the-Lake</a>, as lovely as it was, was not going to impress her. We needed to go farther.</p>
<p>I found out that the <a href="https://tulipfestival.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Tulip Festival</a> and the Victoria Day celebrations in Ottawa coincided with Vero&#x27;s birthday. Plus, Ottawa seemed like a laid-back city with beautiful scenery and lots of other attractions, and was within a reasonable driving distance from Amherst. I booked an Airbnb in Lebreton Flats, and a week or so before the trip, I told Vero what we were doing.</p>
<p>We went to <a href="https://lop.parl.ca/sites/Visit/default/en_CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parliament Hill</a>, the <a href="https://www.gallery.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Gallery</a>, <a href="https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/commissioners-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commissioners Park</a>, walked the pathways along the Rideau Canal and the Ottawa River, ate delicious Indian food in the <a href="https://www.byward-market.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ByWard Market</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, I wouldn&#x27;t mind living here at some point,&quot; I told Vero.</p>
<p>&quot;Me neither,&quot; she agreed.</p>
<p>The three of us fell in love with Ottawa.</p>
<p>Well, actually, the <strong>four</strong> of us. We&#x27;d soon learn that Vero was pregnant with our second child by then.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="struggling-with-my-weight">Struggling with my weight<a href="#struggling-with-my-weight" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Struggling with my weight" title="Direct link to Struggling with my weight">​</a></h2>
<p>By mid-2018, I realized I had put on a lot of weight since Samuel had been born. I was never one to monitor my weight too closely, but by the latter half of my PhD, it was too visible to ignore. I weighed nearly 90 kg at my heaviest. It doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but for someone who stands 1,69 m tall on a good day, I was technically obese.</p>
<p>I think I started overeating in response to stress. It was tough balancing my various obligations. I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care for my wife and son.</li>
<li>Do well in university and finish my PhD before my scholarship dried up.</li>
<li>Be a good teacher to my music theory and history students.</li>
<li>Polish my portfolio so I could get a permanent job.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I had to deal with the fact that, in spite of my best efforts in all of the above, the future of our family was still uncertain.</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t smoke. I couldn&#x27;t drink. I couldn&#x27;t gamble. I couldn&#x27;t splurge. I couldn&#x27;t sleep around. None of the vices other people use to &quot;process&quot; their anxieties and frustrations were available to me. None except for one: food.</p>
<p>I love eating. Nothing boosts my mood quite like a delicious meal with a cold can of pop followed by a delicious dessert. I also love sugary snacks throughout the day and pantry raids in the middle of the night, when everybody else is asleep.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t regret loving food; it&#x27;s one of life&#x27;s great pleasures. What I regret is having poor impulse control and failing to stop myself when I know I should.</p>
<p>As I gained weight, old clothes became tight and unflattering to my figure, and new clothes were always too big for a short man like me. Getting fat made me anxious, and feeling anxious made me overeat even more. Vero was disappointed in me, and I could sense she was becoming less attracted to me.</p>
<p>Regardless, I never let my bad physique get in the way of my happiness, so I trudged on relatively well, hoping that I&#x27;d eventually lose the extra weight when things got easier after my PhD.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="europe-again">Europe again<a href="#europe-again" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Europe again" title="Direct link to Europe again">​</a></h2>
<p>In the summer of 2018, I was selected to participate in the <a href="https://www.royaumont.com/evenement/academie-voix-nouvelles-fsc18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voix Nouvelles</a> academy at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royaumont_Abbey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royaumont abbey</a> north of Paris. Vero and I decided to turn my going to France into a family trip, so I booked a flight for the three of us to London Heathrow two weeks before my residency started.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="london">London<a href="#london" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to London" title="Direct link to London">​</a></h3>
<p>We spent one week in London, discovering the city by bus, train, and on foot.</p>
<p>Our Airbnb was in Crystal Palace, where we saw the hilariously inaccurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_Dinosaurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iguanodon sculptures</a> in the park.</p>
<p>We were dazzled by <a href="https://westminstercathedral.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westminster Cathedral</a>.</p>
<p>We ate fish and chips made by Portuguese immigrants near the <a href="https://www.towerbridge.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tower Bridge</a>. It was cool to speak my mother tongue in an unexpected place.</p>
<p>We poked fun at the tourists waiting in a super long line to go into a <a href="https://www.shreksadventure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shrek-themed attraction</a> near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London Eye</a>. With so many things to see and do in London... Shrek? That&#x27;s what they had travelled however many kilometres for? And who did the attraction appeal to? By then, <em>Shrek</em> was too old to be liked by kids, and not old enough to be liked by their parents, so we refused to believe people had planned to go there; they were just wondering the area and got sucked into the queue by the colourful facade.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="paris">Paris<a href="#paris" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Paris" title="Direct link to Paris">​</a></h3>
<p>When our time in London was up, we set out for Paris via Eurostar.</p>
<p>In my ignorance, I thought that when the train crossed the English Channel, it&#x27;d be like an aquarium tunnel and we&#x27;d see all sorts of marine life swimming around us. Imagine my disappointment when we emerged in Calais and I realized that the walls of the Channel Tunnel were (obviously) made of reinforced concrete and were therefore totally opaque.</p>
<p>Vero had a good laugh, and I felt good because I made her happy with my silliness.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="disillusionment">Disillusionment<a href="#disillusionment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Disillusionment" title="Direct link to Disillusionment">​</a></h4>
<p>We liked Paris less than we liked London. We stayed in Belleville, but it was not very <em>belle</em>. Paris was dirtier than we thought and the people were not very kind. I even got into a few arguments—in French! I was also surprised by the lack of trees on the streets.</p>
<p><em>They conquered half the world for hundreds of years, and what do they have to show for it? Where did all the wealth they plundered go?</em>, we wondered.</p>
<p>Then we went to Versailles.</p>
<p><em>Oh, that&#x27;s where.</em></p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t all bad, of course. The city&#x27;s architecture was breathtaking, and Samuel and I enjoyed playing with toy boats in the pond at the <a href="https://www.senat.fr/lng/en/the-luxembourg-palace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palais du Luxembourg</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, though, we felt that Paris had the dysfunction we saw in Latin America but none of its human warmth. In fact, I&#x27;ll gladly take Curitiba over Paris any day.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-voices">&quot;New voices&quot;<a href="#new-voices" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to &quot;New voices&quot;" title="Direct link to &quot;New voices&quot;">​</a></h4>
<p>After a week in Paris, Vero and Samuel went back home, and I took a train 30 km north to the Royaumont abbey for my month-long composition residency.</p>
<p>Our schedule at Voix Nouvelles consisted of attending lessons, seminars, and rehearsals. And writing music. Writing, re-writing, re-re-writing. I went up to the abbey&#x27;s scriptorium as frequently as I could to work on my manuscript, just like generations of monks had done before. The new piece that came out of this process, <em>Courante</em>, was premiered in a concert toward the end of the residency.</p>
<p>The whole thing was magical. The setting, the events, my fellow students, our mentors, the ensembles we worked with. My favourite part was sitting in the <a href="https://www.royaumont.com/decouvrir-labbaye/les-jardins/le-potager-jardin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potager-Jardin</a> (&quot;vegetable garden&quot;) and listening to <a href="http://jeanlucherve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean-Luc Hervé</a>&#x27;s <a href="https://youtu.be/HeB__NlXU9w?si=QMVXEZ4mKaPVVZs7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Germination</em></a> sound installation.</p>
<p>I constantly felt like the lowest rung on the ladder there, but that made me feel privileged rather than demoralized.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="year-4-ub">Year 4 (UB)<a href="#year-4-ub" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Year 4 (UB)" title="Direct link to Year 4 (UB)">​</a></h2>
<p>I rejoined my family in Amherst shortly after the fall semester had already started at UB. Graduating was a foregone conclusion, so my main concern became finding a job. Seven years after coming up with my <a href="/my-story/wedding#fear-of-failure">career &quot;roadmap&quot;</a>, I was finally ready for step 2.</p>
<p>I knew that universities and colleges typically posted academic jobs 9-12 months before their start date, so I had no time to lose. I re-purposed my <a href="/my-story/first-real-successes#the-spreadsheet">competition spreadsheet</a> into a job application spreadsheet and started logging all the relevant job postings that I could find in the US, Canada, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I applied to dozens and dozens of jobs that fall and got two interviews, one at <a href="https://www.potsdam.edu/academics/crane-school-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SUNY Potsdam</a> and the other at <a href="https://music.byu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BYU</a>, my <a href="/my-story/from-curitiba-to-provo#provo-bound">alma mater</a>.</p>
<p>Neither panned out, so I kept applying.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elias">Elias<a href="#elias" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elias" title="Direct link to Elias">​</a></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Vero&#x27;s pregnancy was advancing. We now had access to health insurance, so Vero received much better care in Buffalo than she had in Utah. When her OB/GYN learned of Samuel&#x27;s difficult birth, they ordered more tests than usual, prescribed her some medicine, and recommended frequent bed rest.</p>
<p>It worked. The baby grew well and healthy until he decided to be born in the winter of 2019, four weeks early. We called him Elias, the Greek version of Elijah. It works well in Portuguese, Spanish, and English and it represents the connection we feel to our ancestors.</p>
<p>It was snowy when Elias was born, but I felt warm and awash with love, and even though he was technically a preemie, he had no issues and had to spend just a day or two at Sisters of Charity Hospital before coming home.</p>
<p>Like his older brother before him, Elias filled my life with tenderness, perspective, and purpose. Even at that early stage, I could tell he was different from Samuel and I was excited to see how the two boys would grow up and lean on each other for friendship and comfort.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/my-story/page/11"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/my-story/page/13"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024.
