<p>I turned 23 in 2011 but didn&#x27;t feel like an adult. In my mind, I was still the wide-eyed teenager from Curitiba. I didn&#x27;t have a clear artistic voice, my portfolio was unremarkable, and my creative output was mutating from &quot;impressive for my age&quot; to &quot;not sure how this will help me get a job&quot; and &quot;maybe I should&#x27;ve become a diplomat like my dad wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my older cousins were finishing their undergraduate degrees and getting jobs, showing me what professional success looked like for international students like us. Their steps became my roadmap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attend university with an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F-1 student visa</a>.</li>
<li>Secure a job to activate F-1&#x27;s &quot;optional practical training&quot; (OPT), a post-graduation temporary work permit.</li>
<li>Have the employer sponsor the transition from F-1 to an <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H-1B work visa</a> after the OPT.</li>
<li>Live out the required number of years on H-1B to qualify for permanent residence, i.e., the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/green-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Card</a>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-84fdc7" id="user-content-fnref-1-84fdc7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>My cousins were also getting married and having babies by then. None of them considered going back to Brazil a viable option. They all wanted to make a life for their families in the US—as did I.</p>
<p>So, I set a couple of goals to help me accomplish it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="goal-1-terminal-degree">Goal 1: Terminal degree<a href="#goal-1-terminal-degree" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Goal 1: Terminal degree" title="Direct link to Goal 1: Terminal degree">​</a></h3>
<p>All of the (living) composers I knew and admired had gone to grad school. No (living) composer I knew was making enough money to raise a family by writing music right out of undergrad. Ergo, I needed to get a master&#x27;s and a doctorate in music composition if I were to get any good at it, and if I got good at it, I&#x27;d land a permanent, well-paying, visa-sponsoring job.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-84fdc7" id="user-content-fnref-2-84fdc7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>... right?</p>
<p>It&#x27;d take me much longer than my cousins to get to the coveted H-1B step, but eventually I&#x27;d get there, and then it would all have been worth the extra effort. I would&#x27;ve had my cake and eaten it too.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="goal-2-family">Goal 2: Family<a href="#goal-2-family" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Goal 2: Family" title="Direct link to Goal 2: Family">​</a></h3>
<p>Vero and I had always had a serious, marriage-oriented relationship. In 2010, we talked about our future and chose to get engaged. We spurned the custom that appeared to prevail in the US that a man should propose to a woman on one knee, seemingly out of the blue, with an expensive diamond ring and a specific short-term wedding date.</p>
<p>In Brazil, engagement is an agreement, not a surprise ultimatum one springs on the other, and then both people wear plain gold bands to show they&#x27;re engaged—somewhat dear, but still a fraction of the price of the diamond rings people go into debt for in the US.</p>
<p>The discussion that culminates in the decision to get married can happen in a specially romantic or significant place for the couple, but usually there are no theatrics involved. Engaged couples then invite their family and friends to a party to announce and celebrate their engagement, and remain engaged for up to a few years until the conditions are right to get married.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3-84fdc7" id="user-content-fnref-3-84fdc7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concepción">Concepción<a href="#concepción" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concepción" title="Direct link to Concepción">​</a></h2>
<p>When I visited Vero in Chile in 2010, we got our wedding bands—courtesy of my maternal grandmother—and announced our engagement to our families and friends.</p>
<p>We thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to get married in December 2011. Vero would be done with university coursework and would need an just additional half year to complete her residency. Incidentally, as an international student in the US, I could defer my studies for a half year, making me able to move to Chile and support her during her residency.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wedding">Wedding<a href="#wedding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wedding" title="Direct link to Wedding">​</a></h3>
<p>Vero and I got married in the church of the <a href="https://maps.churchofjesuschrist.org/wards/130354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University ward</a> in Concepción. The ceremony itself took place in the chapel and was officiated by one of the city&#x27;s justices of the peace (JP). Vero had stressed to me how important it was to be punctual because Chilean JPs were notoriously impatient with delays, but she acted against her own advice and arrived half an hour late to our wedding. I was freaking out, but luckily our JP didn&#x27;t seem to mind Vero&#x27;s tardiness.</p>
<p>After we were married, the JP left and Vero and I went to the nearby campus of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Concepci%C3%B3n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Concepción</a>, her alma mater, to take pictures with a photographer. Meanwhile, our guests started on the appetizers in the church&#x27;s cultural hall.</p>
<p>Our wedding reception was modest but plentiful and fun. Dozens of relatives and friends attended—including my parents, siblings, and an aunt who worked tirelessly that day to decorate the hall we held our reception in. We ate a delicious meal prepared by the catering business Vero worked for on weekends and danced until late that night.</p>
<p>After the reception, Vero and I travelled 500 km north to Santiago, where we were <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/what-happens-in-a-temple-sealing?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sealed in the temple</a> the following day. This ordinance extended our civil marriage beyond death, and deepened our commitment to each other. Then we flew to Uruguay and spent our honeymoon in Punta del Este.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-apartment">First apartment<a href="#first-apartment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First apartment" title="Direct link to First apartment">​</a></h3>
<p>A week later, Vero and I were back in Concepción. We lived in a tiny one-bedroom apartment on Ongolmo, close to Paicaví and Carrera, a central area in the city with lots of young people like us. Nights were rough for me because our neighbours were loud and drunk people often argued and fought in front of our apartment building. Vero slept through it all.</p>
<p>As the seasons changed, we experienced some of the most terrifying windstorms I&#x27;ve ever seen. One time, I was walking back from church alone on a Sunday afternoon when I heard a heart-stopping noise. A powerful gust had lifted a large corrugated zinc sheet from a building behind me and sent it dancing in the air, thundering with each flutter.</p>
<p>Another time, there was such an intense driving rain that water was spouting violently out of the rabbets of our apartment&#x27;s windows. The putty on those windows was old and spotty, so I had an idea: stuff the rabbets with thin plastic bags, like the ones grocery stores used to give customers back then. Vero laughed and laughed, but it worked. It didn&#x27;t look great, but it worked.</p>
<p>I still brag about the presence of mind I showed that day, and Vero still laughs. But I&#x27;ve never minded her laughing. I love to make her laugh more than anybody else.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="censo-2012">Censo 2012<a href="#censo-2012" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Censo 2012" title="Direct link to Censo 2012">​</a></h3>
<p>Before long, Vero settled in her routine at her residency while I looked for a job. Money continued to be a pressing issue because we didn&#x27;t have savings and Vero&#x27;s residency didn&#x27;t pay. I&#x27;d also been taught, for better or worse, that a man&#x27;s worth depends on his work ethic and his ability to financially support his family. Since I was not studying, I had to work.</p>
<p>My first job in Concepción was at a radio station, selling ad space. I hated it and quit after my first paycheque.</p>
<p>Then, I learned about a relatively well-paid, temporary gig for the government that aligned perfectly with our time frame. Chile was going to hold its <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censo_chileno_de_2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decennial census in 2012</a>, and they were looking for an army of census takers. I applied and mysteriously got the job, even though no one else we knew who had applied—and there were many in our age group—had been selected.</p>
<p>I <strong>loved</strong> working for the census. It was all of the fun parts of my mission minus the rejection and heartache. I walked the streets of Concepción 10 hours a day, going from home to home and interviewing people about their lives and families. I met people across the socioeconomic spectrum, from well-to-do traditional families to squatters and drifters.</p>
<p>Being a census taker could be hilarious, too. Many people did not understand the questions we asked—or what the census itself even was. This led to some confusion.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="material">&quot;Material&quot;<a href="#material" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to &quot;Material&quot;" title="Direct link to &quot;Material&quot;">​</a></h4>
<p>I had to ask people what their residences were made of. Most people had no idea. Some people answered &quot;material,&quot; which is as vague and obvious in Spanish as it is in English. They said it with such confidence, too.</p>
<p>I soon learned that some old-timers used &quot;material&quot; in opposition to wood, so it basically meant brick and mortar (for houses) or reinforced concrete (for apartment buildings).</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="being-indigenous">Being indigenous<a href="#being-indigenous" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Being indigenous" title="Direct link to Being indigenous">​</a></h4>
<p>When people declared they were Indigenous, the mandatory follow-up question was about the ethnic group they belonged to. For registered Indigenous people, the answer was straightforward.</p>
<p>Those who self-identified as Indigenous but weren&#x27;t registered didn&#x27;t have strong ties with a particular group, so they were generally stumped. Some of them then walked back and said they weren&#x27;t actually Indigenous, while others doubled down and said that all Chileans should consider themselves Indigenous. These people picked the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mapuche" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapuche</a> as their ethnic group because to them the Mapuche represented anti-colonial resistance.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="polyglots">Polyglots<a href="#polyglots" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Polyglots" title="Direct link to Polyglots">​</a></h4>
<p>The census asked people about the languages they spoke. It was not uncommon for upper middle-class parents to proudly state that their children spoke two, three, four languages. It was not just parental pride; it was a matter of social prestige and a return of their investment.</p>
<p>In Chile, private K-12 schools are the norm for middle-class families. This includes lower middle-class families, who prioritize private education for their children as soon as they can afford it. Some private schools for the upper social classes in Concepción distinguished themselves from the rest by offering foreign-language immersion programs and calling themselves the &quot;British&quot; or the &quot;French&quot; or the &quot;Arabic&quot; school. This fed into the strong pro-foreigner (especially pro-European) bias I&#x27;ve found Chileans to have.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d spoken with Chileans in English and had good reason to doubt those kids spoke all of those languages fluently, but I put down whatever their parents told me.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="audífono">Audífono<a href="#audífono" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Audífono" title="Direct link to Audífono">​</a></h4>
<p>The word for &quot;hearing aid&quot; in Spanish is <em>audífono</em>, which is the same word for &quot;headphones.&quot; One of the questions I had to ask was,</p>
<p><em>Do you have difficulty hearing, even with a</em> hearing aid <em>on?</em></p>
<p>Some young people who didn&#x27;t know what a hearing aid was thought I was asking them,</p>
<p><em>Do you have difficulty hearing when you have</em> headphones <em>on?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes,&quot; one young man told me. &quot;I like to listen to loud music on my iPod and can&#x27;t hear anything when I&#x27;ve got my headphones on.&quot;</p>
<p>I wasn&#x27;t supposed to question people&#x27;s answers and had to record exactly what they said, but  whenever this misunderstanding happened, I&#x27;d clarify what type of <em>audífono</em> I was referring to.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, OK, then no.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="relation">Relation<a href="#relation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Relation" title="Direct link to Relation">​</a></h4>
<p>The census required us to determine how people were related to the head of household. The question we had to ask about each person was something like,</p>
<p><em>Cuál es su relación con el jefe de hogar?</em></p>
<p>which means,</p>
<p><em>How is this person and the head of household related?</em></p>
<p>Possible answers included: self, spouse, child, parent, etc. However, because <em>relación</em> can mean &quot;relationship&quot; in addition to &quot;relation&quot; (as in degree of kinship), what some people heard was,</p>
<p><em>What is this person&#x27;s relationship with the head of household like?</em></p>
<p>Then they&#x27;d start going off about their marital problems or parenting challenges, which people somehow thought the census would like to record.</p>

<p>After the census ended,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4-84fdc7" id="user-content-fnref-4-84fdc7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> I felt empty. I could only watch so much <em>The Office</em> (US) and play so much <em>Batman: Arkham City</em> on my PlayStation 3 before I felt a strong urge to resume &quot;my life&quot; in Orem, as selfish as that was.</p>
