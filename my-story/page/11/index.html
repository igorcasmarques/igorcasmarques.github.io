<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="escenas"><em>Escenas</em><a href="#escenas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to escenas" title="Direct link to escenas">​</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://library.buffalo.edu/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Library</a> was my happy place at <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UB</a>. Whenever I needed to study, compose, prepare classes, listen to music, I just went to the Library. Sometimes I worked in a cubicle next to the street-facing windows, sometimes I worked on one of their wide solid wood tables. Either way, I was more productive in the Library than at home or in the windowless closet that was my assigned office space.</p>
<p>I also have always enjoyed the smell of books, new and old.</p>
<p>The Library had a large collection of music scores, including much 20th and 21st century music. I often browsed shelves aimlessly until something piqued my interest.</p>
<p>This is how I discovered <a href="https://www.carolabauckholt.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carola Bauckholt</a>&#x27;s <a href="https://youtu.be/NZxCgsv26P0?si=OY_2r72wgnXidhMb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">String Trio (1994)</a> in 2016. I fell under the piece&#x27;s spell, and it inspired me to write my own string trio.</p>
<p>I called this trio <em>Escenas</em> because it was inspired by scenes of my relationship with Samuel. One such scene was watching long compilations of passing trains by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoasterFan2105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoasterFan2105</a> on YouTube. We also had fun doing this in person; we&#x27;d go to the Depew Station on Sunday afternoons, sit on the platform benches, and just watch the trains go by.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="arditti-residency">Arditti residency<a href="#arditti-residency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Arditti residency" title="Direct link to Arditti residency">​</a></h3>
<p>As soon as I learned that the <a href="https://ardittiquartet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arditti Quartet</a> would be coming to UB in 2017 to present a concert and and hold a recording session, I added a second violin to <em>Escenas</em>.</p>
<p>My trio became a quartet, just like that. That&#x27;s how much I wanted to work with the Arditti Quartet.</p>
<p>My fellow students and I were all intimidated by the coming of the &quot;Ardittis,&quot; as we affectionately called them. In terms of new music, they were (and still are) the pre-eminent string quartet in the world. And they had a reputation for extreme candour and zero tolerance for mistakes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.david-felder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Felder</a> emphasized the importance of being well prepared for the recording session with the Arditti Quartet.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, be careful with the &#x27;Arditti fourth&#x27;,&quot; he told us. &quot;It&#x27;s the tritone between G3 and C♯4, which, as you know, is impossible to play on the violin.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-72b223" id="user-content-fnref-2-72b223" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Yet, you&#x27;d be surprised at how often it appears in student scores. And it sets off Irvine [Arditti] every time.&quot;</p>
<p>My father&#x27;s voice echoed in my mind, &quot;If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.&quot;<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-72b223" id="user-content-fnref-1-72b223" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The workshop and recording session went as I expected. Some people had a good time, some didn&#x27;t. One person even left the session abruptly and scurried out of the hall because they felt embarrassed. For me, however, things went very well. I had prepared the score of <em>Escenas</em> as best as I could, and the Arditti Quartet played it masterfully.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-wins">More wins<a href="#more-wins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More wins" title="Direct link to More wins">​</a></h3>
<p>The recording that came out of this session became a centrepiece in my portfolio, helping me nab two more wins for <em>Escenas</em> in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a finalist in the <a href="https://www.mivosquartet.com/12th-mivoskanter-string-quartet-composition-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mivos/Kanter Prize</a> of the <a href="https://www.mivosquartet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mivos Quartet</a>.</li>
<li>As a finalist in the Música Hoje contest in my hometown of Curitiba, where it was premiered by the city&#x27;s chamber orchestra in August. The competition&#x27;s director had been my professor at <a href="/my-story/from-curitiba-to-provo#ufpr">UFPR</a>, so my music had gone &quot;full circle&quot; since I left Brazil.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summertime">Summertime<a href="#summertime" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summertime" title="Direct link to Summertime">​</a></h2>
<p>The spring came and my 2nd year at UB was over. In the summer, two things preoccupied me: teaching an online section of MUS 116 (Music Theory for Non-Majors) and going on a trip with my family to Florida.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="youtube-channel">YouTube channel<a href="#youtube-channel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YouTube channel" title="Direct link to YouTube channel">​</a></h3>
<p>By that point, I had taught MUS 116 several times in person and once online. Vero suggested I should teach it with a wider audience in mind this time and make my lectures <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@musictheory1017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly available on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Online teaching in 2017 was nothing like what it has become since the pandemic. It was normal for instructors to teach asynchronously via email chains and PDFs. We set deadlines for homework and quizzes, and then marked the students&#x27; submissions. We rarely engaged with students in real time.</p>
<p>Vero&#x27;s suggestion would elevate my course above the glorified newsletter that used to pass for online teaching, but it also meant considerable extra work.</p>
<p>&quot;But if you do it well, it&#x27;ll be good for your resume,&quot; she advised. She convinced me.</p>
<p>Over the course of the summer term, I published 25 videos about music theory on YouTube. To date, my channel has garnered over 107,000 views. I haven&#x27;t added anything to the channel since that summer, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will, but it has been gratifying to see the scale of the impact my teaching could have.</p>
<p>That episode also reinforced to me how important it was to listen to Vero&#x27;s counsel. I have since made many more positive life-changing decisions based on her advice. Writing this story, in fact, is one of them.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cruise">Cruise<a href="#cruise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cruise" title="Direct link to Cruise">​</a></h3>
<p>Somehow, my father found a very good deal on a cruise from Florida to The Bahamas in August, and offered to give us three cruise tickets if we took care of the airfares. We&#x27;d been holding on to a voucher from JetBlue that we got after we volunteered to opt out of an overbooked flight, so flying would also be free for us.</p>
<p>We accepted my father&#x27;s gift, took a direct flight from Buffalo to Fort Lauderdale, and set up a base in Boca Ratón.</p>
<p>Before the cruise departed, we spent several days exploring southern Florida, from Cape Canaveral to Key West. My favourite part of this leg of the trip was visiting NASA&#x27;s <a href="https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kennedy Space Center</a>, where we watched a live launch. It was hot, humid, and Samuel cried when everyone started yelling the countdown, but it didn&#x27;t matter; watching the rocket go into space awed us.</p>
<p>Our cruise was very nice, too, but I wasn&#x27;t able to relax as much as I thought I would. On the one hand, it was great to unplug from all responsibilities, loaf around, go for a swim, eat heaps of delicious food, visit paradisiacal islands. This part I really liked.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, Samuel slept through the night for the first time EVER during this cruise. What a random place for this milestone.)</p>
<p>However, I felt morally ambivalent about the whole thing. The cruise ship was literally a giant floating casino, and being there felt wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. I also didn&#x27;t like the lazy and gluttonous person I became there.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#x27;m too ascetic.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3-72b223" id="user-content-fnref-3-72b223" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hurricanes">Hurricanes<a href="#hurricanes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hurricanes" title="Direct link to Hurricanes">​</a></h3>
<p>When we came home from the trip, we found out why the cruise tickets had been cheap: August is peak hurricane season in that area.</p>
<p>We&#x27;d seen a scary storm in Key West, but our cruise was uneventful. Huge cyclones started buffeting the region mere days after we left. In 2017, hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria laid waste to Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, respectively.</p>
<p>We were glad to have escaped all of that.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="year-3-ub">Year 3 (UB)<a href="#year-3-ub" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Year 3 (UB)" title="Direct link to Year 3 (UB)">​</a></h2>
<p>My biggest concern going into my third year at UB were my upcoming comprehensive exams—or <em>comps</em>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="comps">Comps<a href="#comps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Comps" title="Direct link to Comps">​</a></h3>
<p>As the name implies, the comps covered all subjects in musicology, music theory, music history, orchestration, etc. My comps would mark the official end of my coursework, so I was happy not to have to worry about course marks ever again.</p>
<p>I was advised to set apart six months to study for my comps, so I scheduled them in the spring of 2018 to give me enough time to prepare while also tending to my other responsibilities.</p>
<p>The comps were hard but fair. There were only three questions, and the expectation was that I&#x27;d write (by hand) as much as I could about each topic during the allotted three hours. I took the test in my beloved Music Library, passed, and went from PhD student to PhD candidate. In graduate lingo, I was now <em>ABD</em>: all but dissertation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pre-school">Pre-school<a href="#pre-school" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pre-school" title="Direct link to Pre-school">​</a></h3>
<p>By the fall of 2017, Samuel qualified to attend a state-sponsored pre-school full time. He struggled at first, but the pre-school&#x27;s caring staff helped him adapt to the new social environment and grow.</p>
<p>The pre-school was adjacent to the UB campus, and was an annex of a retirement community. I volunteered there once or twice a week to help clean up messes and play songs on the guitar for the kids. One time, Samuel and I even performed a little concert on the piano for his classmates and some of the elderly residents.</p>
<p>Being with my son in his pre-school was the highlight of my week.</p>
<p>Now that Samuel had started going to school and the end of my PhD was in sight, I started to feel a familiar itch: it was time for a new baby. How cool would it be have a picture holding <strong>two children</strong> while wearing my PhD regalia at convocation?</p>

<p>The lowest open string on the violin is a G3. The next open string is a D4, above C♯4. Since violinists can only produce one note per string, and C♯4 can only be played on the G string, the Arditti fourth is impossible to play without a <em>scordatura</em>, i.e., a non-standard tuning of the violin&#x27;s strings. <a href="#user-content-fnref-2-72b223" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>
