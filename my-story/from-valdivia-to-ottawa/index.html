<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hola-valdivia">¡Hola, Valdivia!<a href="#hola-valdivia" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ¡Hola, Valdivia!" title="Direct link to ¡Hola, Valdivia!">​</a></h2>
<p>When we arrived in Chile, Vero and the boys stayed with Karina&#x27;s family in Linares while I went down to Valdivia with Felipe, Vero&#x27;s brother, to furnish the apartment we had rented sight unseen.</p>
<p>I was only away for a few days, but Elias didn&#x27;t take my absence well and side-eyed me for weeks thereafter, clinging to Vero.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-samuel">About Samuel<a href="#about-samuel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About Samuel" title="Direct link to About Samuel">​</a></h2>
<p>About a month after our family had moved to Valdivia, Samuel turned eight years old. The baby who&#x27;d <a href="/my-story/samuel#hard-delivery">struggled to be born</a> was now a healthy, active, imaginative, and sensitive boy, and I was immensely proud of him.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="personality">Personality<a href="#personality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Personality" title="Direct link to Personality">​</a></h3>
<p>Samuel had taken longer to start talking than most children but was a precocious reader and avidly curious, going from obsessive interest to obsessive interest. First it was trains, next it was black holes, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon</em></a>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-cac523" id="user-content-fnref-1-cac523" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>He had such an active imagination that when he didn&#x27;t have toys at hand to play out a story he had in his mind, he&#x27;d just use body, gesticulating wildly, narrating, vocalizing all sorts of sound effects. He did this in public, too, without a whiff of self-consciousness, and I never reprimanded him for it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I often praised his imagination because I remember being told that I was too old for certain activities and tastes when I was growing up. Back then, adults thought it was their duty to push boys to maturity as quickly as possible, and since they thought being imaginative was a childish trait, they discouraged it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="baptism">Baptism<a href="#baptism" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Baptism" title="Direct link to Baptism">​</a></h3>
<p>Turning eight is an important milestone for members of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church</a>. We often refer to eight years old as the &quot;<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2000/02/the-age-of-accountability-why-am-i-baptized-when-i-am-eight-years-old" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age of accountability</a>&quot; because it marks the transition between the total innocence of infancy and early childhood and the growing moral awareness of older children. This means that people older than eight years old are eligible for <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/baptism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baptism</a> and should strive to make better choices every day.</p>
<p>Typically, children &quot;born in the covenant,&quot; i.e., to parents who are active members of the Church, are baptized and confirmed by their fathers on their eighth birthday, and that&#x27;s what Samuel and I did.</p>
<p>Vero&#x27;s family drove hundreds of km south from Concepción and Linares to attend Samuel&#x27;s baptism, and my parents flew in from Brazil. After the baptism, we enjoyed a meal in the mild weather of late summer in southern Chile. It was a happy day for our whole family.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discipline">Discipline<a href="#discipline" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discipline" title="Direct link to Discipline">​</a></h3>
<p>Sweet moments like Samuel&#x27;s baptism make me reflect about my shortcomings as a father.</p>
<p>When we <a href="/my-story/from-orem-to-amherst">lived in Amherst</a>, I had some misguided ideas about Samuel&#x27;s discipline. He had a penchant for loud meltdowns and I was scared he&#x27;d become a spoiled brat if I didn&#x27;t punish him hard enough. I was never violent, but I could be stern. Sometimes too stern.</p>
<p>I regret being like this with Samuel when he was a little child. It&#x27;s so out-of-character for me that I wonder how I was ever capable of acting that way with him. I guess parenting does push one to their limits.</p>
<p>The mistakes I made in my first years as a father eventually made me decide two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will show <em>and</em> tell my sons that I love them daily.</li>
<li>I will facilitate positive experiences for my sons so they can remember their childhood with fondness.</li>
</ul>
<p>To hell with the persistent Victorian notion that showing affection to boys &quot;coddles&quot; them and makes them &quot;weak.&quot; I want my sons to know that I love them without doubt, and it is this love that will make them strong and resilient.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="uach-year-2">UACh (Year 2)<a href="#uach-year-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UACh (Year 2)" title="Direct link to UACh (Year 2)">​</a></h2>
<p>Classes resumed at UACh in late March. I was invested in the materials that I taught, and students responded well to that. I prioritized content I thought would be equal parts useful and relatable and we played a lot of music in class. I had fun teaching at UACh, I was productive, I supported my fellow faculty members, and my research into video game music was becoming more sophisticated.</p>
<p>In other words, my career was taking off.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dilemma">Dilemma<a href="#dilemma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dilemma" title="Direct link to Dilemma">​</a></h3>
<p>Then, in the Chilean autumn, more than two years after we had started our <a href="/my-story/from-amherst-to-curitiba#points">Express Entry process</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRCC</a> approved our Permanent Residence (PR) in Canada.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t know how to feel. Had this come two years earlier, when we were still in Amherst, I would&#x27;ve been ecstatic. But now, so much had changed. After settling in Valdivia and enjoying the start of a promising career, maybe Canada was no longer the best option for our family.</p>
<p>Vero and I talked, and we agreed that going to Canada would be a setback for our family. She wouldn&#x27;t be able to work as a dentist there, and I would most likely have to reset my career or change careers altogether. We&#x27;d probably burn through our savings until we found our feet in the new country. And we&#x27;d probably never own a home, considering how unaffordable houses are in Canada.</p>
<p>But the North beckoned to us. It held out a promise of stability, safety, and good education for our sons. Going to Canada felt right.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="second-semester">Second semester<a href="#second-semester" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Second semester" title="Direct link to Second semester">​</a></h3>
<p>I gave my department chair at UACh a six-month notice of my departure, and continued to work, write, compose, and research like I&#x27;d been doing all along. My imminent move didn&#x27;t dampen my creative urges or interfere with my teaching. In my final semester at UACh:</p>
<ul>
<li>I composed three major works:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><em>Venga mi amado</em> for baroque orchestra, recorded by <a href="https://orquestanuevomundo.net/orquesta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orquesta Barroca Nuevo Mundo</a> and <a href="https://sellomodular.bandcamp.com/album/ra-ces-imaginadas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released by Sello Modular</a> thanks to a generous grant from the government of Chile.</li>
<li><em>Sea lo que fuere, no lo es</em> for large choir, premiered in Valdivia&#x27;s main theatre, <a href="https://teatroregionalcervantes.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teatro Cervantes</a>.</li>
<li><em>Conmutación</em> for a large ensemble with traditional instruments and found objects, premiered in <a href="https://www.relinchafestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Festival Relincha</a>, the foremost annual gathering of experimental musicians in southern Chile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I presented my research findings at a major conference in Valparaíso by the <a href="https://iaspmal.com/index.php/2023/08/01/fronteras-rutas-horizontes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Association for the Study of Popular Music</a>. One of my students at UACh also presented a paper he&#x27;d written under my guidance in this conference.</li>
<li>I was awarded a commission from the <a href="https://barlow.byu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barlow Endowment</a> for a new work for electronically modified piano.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emotionally, I kept it together until the end of classes, after which point the complexities of our move started to eat at me.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-in-canada">Where in Canada?<a href="#where-in-canada" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where in Canada?" title="Direct link to Where in Canada?">​</a></h2>
<p>Vero and I were tired of dragging our suitcases across continents and resetting our lives every so often. This instability was also taking a psychological toll on our sons.</p>
<p>It was time to put down roots somewhere, so we made a list of locations in Canada that we saw ourselves living in, from Vancouver to Halifax, and pondered the possibilities.</p>
<p>We crossed off Québec because we weren&#x27;t allowed to move there; they have their own separate immigration system. We also thought the northern territories would be inhospitable to newcomers with no connections or prior experience in Canada.</p>
<p>While we were weighing the pros and cons of locations in the remaining six provinces, <a href="https://rdpolytech.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Deer Polytechnic</a> (RDP) offered me an adjunct position to teach a three-credit course on popular music. It was quite a downgrade from what I&#x27;d done at <a href="/my-story/from-curitiba-to-valdivia#uach-year-1">UACh</a> and <a href="/my-story/graduation-ub#ub-reprise">UB</a>, but it represented continuity in my career. And who knows, maybe it would lead to other opportunities.</p>
<p>Vero and I stopped searching for our family&#x27;s next home because life had made that choice: Red Deer, AB.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, don&#x27;t come to Red Deer, Igor,&quot; my supervisor at RDP advised me. &quot;Teach this course online and go live some other place. We can only offer you this one course and only once a year. RDP doesn&#x27;t have a music program, and there&#x27;s not much else happening in town. Your career awaits elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Their candour saved our family a lot of heartache, and I appreciated it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Vero and I decided to settle in Ottawa because of its moderate size, reputation, amenities, job opportunities, and proximity to two airports with direct flights to South America (Toronto Pearson and Montréal-Trudeau).</p>
<p>However, when people ask me why we&#x27;ve come to Ottawa, I just tell them that I threw a dart at a map of Canada and that&#x27;s where it landed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hello-bonjour-ottawa">Hello bonjour, Ottawa!<a href="#hello-bonjour-ottawa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hello bonjour, Ottawa!" title="Direct link to Hello bonjour, Ottawa!">​</a></h2>
<p>We left Chile between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s of 2022.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="déjà-vu">Déjà vu<a href="#déjà-vu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Déjà vu" title="Direct link to Déjà vu">​</a></h3>
<p>Leaving Chile wasn&#x27;t easy, though.</p>
<p>Chile&#x27;s federal police, <a href="https://pdichile.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Policía de Investigaciones</em></a> (PDI), refused to let us leave the country because of the stupidest technicality: Elias had entered Chile as a Chilean national, so he had to leave Chile as a Chilean national. Because we were going to Canada, that meant that he needed a Chilean passport with a visa to Canada.</p>
<p>But we had neither of these documents because we didn&#x27;t need either of these documents. Elias was a US citizen and a permanent resident of Canada, and had his PR stamped on his American passport. This was all we needed to move to Canada.</p>
<p>But the PDI officer didn&#x27;t care, and sent us away. Like in our <a href="/my-story/graduation-ub#wait">previous immigration woes</a>, we begged and grovelled and abased ourselves to no avail.</p>
<p>Getting Elias&#x27;s Chilean passport could take months and would likely force us to renew other documents that were set to expire soon. If this ordeal spiralled out of control, we&#x27;d miss our deadline to enter Canada and our PR would be revoked. All our sacrifices would&#x27;ve been for nothing.</p>
<p>We needed to find a way around this immigration obstacle ASAP.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-plan">New plan<a href="#new-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New plan" title="Direct link to New plan">​</a></h3>
<p>We realized that if we re-booked our flight so that it laid over in a South American country before making it to Canada, Elias could leave Chile with his Chilean ID. No passport needed. Then, we&#x27;d use his American passport with the PR stamp between the intermediary country and Canada.</p>
<p>Our workaround was viable, but we had to act fast because the window for re-booking our flight was closing. I sat down in an isolated corner of the airport, my phone struggling with low battery, the airline&#x27;s buggy app, and one bar of mobile data. Wi-Fi was even worse.</p>
<p>With tears streaming down my face, I was able to reschedule our flight so that it stopped in Colombia before going to Toronto. I was barely able to do it, but I did it. Vero and I then gathered our suitcases and made our way to the airline&#x27;s baggage counter to drop them off.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="second-snag">Second snag<a href="#second-snag" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Second snag" title="Direct link to Second snag">​</a></h3>
<p>When we got there, the airline&#x27;s ticketing agent barred us from checking in, arguing that we needed visas to enter Canada.</p>
<p><em>Not this again.</em></p>
<p>We insisted that, &quot;No, we don&#x27;t actually need visas because we are permanent residents of Canada,&quot; and showed them our corroborating documents. But it was fruitless. Like the PDI officer before, the airline agent wouldn&#x27;t budge. We implored them to seek guidance from their supervisor or their counterparts in Colombia and Canada, and sat down on the floor near the check-in counter waiting for a resolution.</p>
<p>Elias and Samuel were distraught and exhausted and didn&#x27;t understand what was going on.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, late into the night and a few minutes before our flight&#x27;s boarding closed, the ticketing agent received news about our case and agreed to check us in. Then, at the PDI checkpoint, we handed our tickets to Colombia and our Chilean ID cards to the border officer, and they let us through immediately.</p>
<p>Our plan had worked.</p>
<p>We bolted for the gate and boarded our flight during the last call. I stowed our carry-on bags in the airplane&#x27;s overhead bins, sat down, let out a big sigh, and vowed never to travel internationally again until I had a Canadian passport.</p>
<p>Two days later, we were in our new home in Barrhaven, a suburb in southwest Ottawa.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
