<p>A year into my mission, I was transferred to Long Branch on the Jersey shore.</p>
<p>That area showed me the extent of wealth inequality in the US. We&#x27;d meet undocumented men who worked as day labourers and lived in cramped rooms with no beds or furniture of any kind in Asbury Park. We&#x27;d meet children with rotten teeth and tattered clothing practically raising themselves on the street because it was better than being home with their parents.</p>
<p>Then we&#x27;d drive down Ocean Ave and gawk at the mansions in Deal.</p>
<p>One time, my companion and I were caught in an unexpected thunderstorm while we were out on the street. We stopped under an eave to wait out the storm. A few moments later, one of the most random things that I saw on my mission happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>A minivan parked on the street.</li>
<li>A man got off the minivan.</li>
<li>He hurried to a house nearby and entered it.</li>
<li>He came out of the house with an umbrella.</li>
<li>He handed us the umbrella.</li>
<li>He got back in the minivan and drove off.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="atlantic-city">Atlantic City<a href="#atlantic-city" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Atlantic City" title="Direct link to Atlantic City">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>I spent my second winter in the mission in Pleasantville, near Atlantic City. Come December, we said yes to everyone who invited us for supper on Christmas eve. We went from home to home to home on a sort of holiday binge and ate a ridiculous amount of food on December 24, 2008.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-branch">The branch<a href="#the-branch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The branch" title="Direct link to The branch">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>We didn&#x27;t have an actual church building in Atlantic City. Spanish-speaking members in the area attended a branch that rented a space in the city. This branch held two sacrament meetings each Sunday, one in the morning and one in the evening. No other congregation in the Church does this, as far as I&#x27;m aware. Ostensibly, they did this to accommodate the members&#x27; schedules, who had competing work shifts at the casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t really work out, though. Most people came in the morning. The attendance for the evening services was abysmal, and the few people who came consistently in the evening just took turns giving talks and saying the prayers. It was a little sad.</p>
<p>The Atlantic City Spanish branch no longer exists. It was moribund when I was there during the 2008 recession, and I imagine that the closure of several casinos in the mid 2010s must&#x27;ve driven off many of the Spanish-speaking immigrants in the area, whom the casinos employed as cooks, housekeepers, busboys, etc.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="confrontation">Confrontation<a href="#confrontation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Confrontation" title="Direct link to Confrontation">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>As missionaries, we were used to belligerent people, and knew how to handle them. We were not shy about defending our beliefs when someone was hostile to us, but we tried to avoid confrontation as much as possible because it wasn&#x27;t productive: religious discussions animated by anger are tugs of war with no winners.</p>
<p>We aspired to live by this verse in the Book of Mormon,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He that hath the spirit of contention is not of [God], but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we sensed that people just wanted to argue with us, we tried to retreat diplomatically. If they weren&#x27;t ready to engage us in good faith on that occasion, at least we hoped they&#x27;d remember us as decent people. But some people trapped us before attacking us (verbally, mostly).</p>
<p>Whenever my companion and I were tired of working in Atlantic City, we took the train to Egg Harbor City and worked there. One of those days, a man didn&#x27;t send us away after knocking on his door and talked to us on the doorstep. That was rare.</p>
<p>&quot;Elder... Mar-KAY? Mar-KEE? What is that, French?,&quot; he asked me.</p>
<p>&quot;Portuguese. You can call me Mar-KES. I&#x27;m Brazilian.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brazilian? You&#x27;re white. Blue eyes. Where&#x27;re your folks from?&quot;</p>
<p>I got that all the time. People didn&#x27;t realize Brazil was a diverse country. But this man wasn&#x27;t ignorant; I could tell he was baiting me.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;re also Brazilian,&quot; I replied. &quot;In fact, my ancestors have been in Brazil since the 1700s. And before that, Portugal. Pretty standard for Brazilians.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all. You&#x27;re pure white. Not a hint of black or brown. You come from a lineage of untainted slave owners and Indian killers, don&#x27;t you? Hundreds of years in Brazil and not one of your ancestors wanted to sleep with a black lady?&quot;<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t know how to respond. The man was right, at least partially. I do have slave-owning ancestors. But that&#x27;s just one branch of my family tree. There was also family lore about a great-great-grandmother who was a freedwoman from the early 1800s in Minas Gerais and another one who belonged to an indigenous group in southern MaranhÃ£o.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Before I could think of a rebuttal, he invited us in, and we sat with him in his living room. We never refused an invitation to enter a home. He continued to be edgy and toy with us just to see how we would react. He was bored on a Saturday afternoon, and we were his entertainment.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to be gay, you know. I know how you guys feel about gays,&quot; he said. The Church had been on the news recently for sponsoring ads in support of <a href="https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/lgbtq/prop8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 8</a>, which banned same-sex marriage in California that year.</p>
<p>&quot;But I grew out of that,&quot; he continued. &quot;As soon as I tried ladies, I realized I really, really liked them.&quot; He then described how he had met his wife, who was upstairs, in graphic detail.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t feel threatened by that man, but I did feel icky after the visit. Fortunately, shortly after leaving that man&#x27;s house, we met a nice Honduran family, who invited us to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baleadas</a> with them. They were modest and kind and sharing a meal with them restored my spirit.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="princeton">Princeton<a href="#princeton" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Princeton" title="Direct link to Princeton">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>After Atlantic City, my mission leaders sent me to Princeton, an English-speaking area, to finish my mission. It was springtime, and the streets in Princeton were fragrant, abuzz with bumblebees, and dressed in bright colours. It was unreal.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="companionship-troubles">Companionship troubles<a href="#companionship-troubles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Companionship troubles" title="Direct link to Companionship troubles">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Flowers aside, my time in Princeton was weird. On the one hand, I was at my boldest as a missionary. The apathy of the university community toward us somehow energized me, and I started to feel empowered by rejection. I walked upright and didn&#x27;t have a problem talking to anyone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I hardly connected with anybody. My first companion there was terrible. He refused to talk to people and chewed me out openly in front of anyone. He&#x27;d been seeing a therapist, but the pressures of missionary work got to him and he ended up going home a few weeks later, six months before his release date.</p>
<p>The missionary that replaced him was lazy and petty, but not as mean. We worked less than we should&#x27;ve and had zero success.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technically-i-taught-at-princeton">Technically, I taught at Princeton<a href="#technically-i-taught-at-princeton" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technically, I taught at Princeton" title="Direct link to Technically, I taught at Princeton">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>With one exception.</p>
<p>A woman in her twenties was receptive to our messages. She was uncommonly bright and genuine, and was pursuing a graduate degree at Princeton. She&#x27;d become good friends with a classmate who was a member of our ward, but I don&#x27;t think she had ulterior motives vis-Ã -vis her friend when she met with us; I think she was truly interested in what we had to say.</p>
<p>My companion and I shared our messages with this young woman and her member friend once a week in a classroom on campus. She eventually lost interest, and I still blame myself for that.</p>

<p>Regrets aside, I was never trunky<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> in Princeton and continued to work hard until my last day on the field.</p>
