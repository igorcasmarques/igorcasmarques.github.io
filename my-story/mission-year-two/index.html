<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="long-branch">Long Branch<a href="#long-branch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Long Branch" title="Direct link to Long Branch">​</a></h2>
<p>A year into my mission, I was transferred to Long Branch on the Jersey shore.</p>
<p>That area showed me the extent of wealth inequality in the US. We&#x27;d meet undocumented men who worked as day labourers and lived in cramped rooms with no beds or furniture of any kind. We&#x27;d meet children with rotten teeth and tattered clothing practically raising themselves on the street because it was better than being home with their parents.</p>
<p>Then we&#x27;d drive down Ocean Ave and gawk at the mansions in Deal.</p>
<p>One time, my companion and I were caught in an unexpected thunderstorm while we were out on the street. We stopped under an eave to wait out the storm. A few moments later, this happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>A minivan parked on the street.</li>
<li>A man got off the minivan.</li>
<li>He hurried to a house nearby and entered it.</li>
<li>He came out of the house with an umbrella.</li>
<li>He handed us the umbrella.</li>
<li>He got back in the minivan and drove off.</li>
</ol>
<p>That was one of the most random things that has ever happened to me.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="atlantic-city">Atlantic City<a href="#atlantic-city" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Atlantic City" title="Direct link to Atlantic City">​</a></h2>
<p>I spent my second winter in the mission in Atlantic City, NJ. Come Christmastime, we said yes to everyone who invited us for supper on Christmas eve. We went from home to home to home on a sort of holiday binge and ate a ridiculous amount of food that December 24.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ac-branch">AC branch<a href="#ac-branch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AC branch" title="Direct link to AC branch">​</a></h3>
<p>We didn&#x27;t have an actual church building in AC. Spanish-speaking members in the area attended a branch that rented a space in the city. This branch held two sacrament meetings each Sunday, one in the morning and one in the evening. No other congregation in the Church does this, as far as I&#x27;m aware. Ostensibly, they did this to accommodate the members&#x27; schedules, who had competing work shifts at the AC casinos.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t really work out, though. Most people came in the morning. The attendance for the evening services was abysmal, and the few people who came consistently in the evening just took turns giving talks and saying the prayers. It was a little sad.</p>
<p>The AC Spanish branch no longer exists. It was moribund when I was there during the 2008 recession, and must have gotten worse when several casinos closed down in the mid 2010s. I imagine this downturn drove off the Spanish-speaking immigrants in the area, whom the casinos employed as cooks, housekeepers, busboys, etc. The pandemic and the rise of sports betting and online gambling in recent years must have sealed the deal.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="confrontation">Confrontation<a href="#confrontation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Confrontation" title="Direct link to Confrontation">​</a></h3>
<p>We were used to belligerent people. We were not shy about defending our beliefs when someone was hostile to us, but we tried to avoid confrontation as much as possible because it was not productive. It was a tug of war with no winners.</p>
<p>We lived by this verse in the Book of Mormon,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He that hath the spirit of contention is not of [God], but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-7a6928" id="user-content-fnref-1-7a6928" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we sensed that people just wanted to argue with us, we tried to retreat diplomatically. If they weren&#x27;t going to share our beliefs, at least we hoped they&#x27;d remember us as decent people. But some people trapped us before attacking us (verbally, mostly).</p>
<p>Whenever my companion and I were tired of working in AC, we took the train to Egg Harbor City and worked there. One of those days, a man didn&#x27;t send us away after knocking on his door and talked to us on the doorstep. That was rare.</p>
<p>&quot;Elder... Mar-KAY? Mar-KEE? What is that, French?,&quot; he asked me.</p>
<p>&quot;Portuguese. You can call me Mar-KES. I&#x27;m Brazilian.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brazilian? You&#x27;re white. Blue eyes. Where&#x27;re your folks from?&quot;</p>
<p>I got that all the time. People did not realize Brazil is a diverse country. But this man was not ignorant. I could tell he was baiting me.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;re also Brazilian,&quot; I replied. &quot;In fact, my ancestors have been in Brazil since the 1700s. And before that, Portugal. Pretty standard for Brazilians.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all. You&#x27;re pure white. Not a hint of black or brown. You come from a lineage of untainted slave owners and Indian killers, don&#x27;t you? Hundreds of years in Brazil and not one of your ancestors wanted to sleep with a black lady?&quot;<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-7a6928" id="user-content-fnref-2-7a6928" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t know how to respond. The man was right, at least partially. I do have slave-owning ancestors. But that&#x27;s just one branch of my family tree. There was also family lore about a freedwoman ancestor from the early 1800s in Minas Gerais and another one who belonged to an indigenous group in southern Maranhão.</p>
<p>But there was no point in contradicting the man. He bid us go in, and we sat in his living room. We never refused an invitation to enter a home. He continued to be edgy and toy with us just to see how we would react. He was bored on a Saturday afternoon, and we were his entertainment.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to be gay, you know. I know how you guys feel about gays,&quot; he said. The Church had been on the news recently for sponsoring ads in support of <a href="https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/lgbtq/prop8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposition 8</a>, which banned same-sex marriage in California that year. &quot;But I grew out of that,&quot; he continued. &quot;As soon as I tried ladies, I realized I really, really liked them.&quot; He the described how he had met his wife, who was upstairs, in graphic detail.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t feel threatened by that man, but I did feel icky after the visit. I soon felt better when later that day we found a nice Honduran family and made baleadas with them. They were modest and kind and sharing a meal with them restored my spirit.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="princeton">Princeton<a href="#princeton" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Princeton" title="Direct link to Princeton">​</a></h2>
<p>My mission leaders sent me to Princeton, NJ, an English-speaking area, to finish my mission. Spring in Princeton was unreal. The streets were fragrant, abuzz with bumblebees, and dressed in bright colours.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="companionship-troubles">Companionship troubles<a href="#companionship-troubles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Companionship troubles" title="Direct link to Companionship troubles">​</a></h3>
<p>My time in Princeton was weird. On the one hand, I was at my boldest as a missionary. The apathy of the university community toward us somehow energized me, and I started to feel empowered by rejection. I walked upright and did not have a problem talking to anyone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I hardly connected with anybody. My first companion there was terrible. He refused to talk to people and chewed me out openly in front of anyone. He&#x27;d been seeing a therapist, but the pressures of missionary work got to him and he ended up going home a few weeks later, six months before his release date.</p>
<p>The missionary that replaced him was lazy and petty, but not as mean. We worked less than we should and had zero success. With one exception.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technically-i-taught-at-princeton">Technically, I taught at Princeton<a href="#technically-i-taught-at-princeton" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technically, I taught at Princeton" title="Direct link to Technically, I taught at Princeton">​</a></h3>
<p>A woman in her twenties was receptive to our messages. She was was pursuing a graduate degree at Princeton and had become good friends with a classmate who was a member of our ward. I&#x27;m not sure if she had ulterior motives vis-à-vis her friend, but I don&#x27;t think she did. She was bright and genuine. My companion and I shared our messages with her and her friend once a week in a classroom on campus. She eventually lost interest, and I still blame myself for that.</p>
<p>Missionaries say they are &quot;trunky&quot; when they feel indolent toward the end of their missions, i.e., their trunks are packed and they are fixated about going home. Regrets aside, I was never &quot;trunky&quot; in Princeton and continued to work hard until my last day on the field in late May 2009.</p>
