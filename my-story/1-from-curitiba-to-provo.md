*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* 

## College or university? Both!

In late 2005, at the age of 17, I took the entrance exams for [music production](https://sacod.ufpr.br/artes/musica-licenciatura-e-bacharelado/) at the [Federal University of Paraná](https://ufpr.br/) (UFPR) and for [music composition and conducting](https://embap.curitiba1.unespar.edu.br/menu-ensino/graduacao/bacharelado-em-composicao-e-regencia) at the state's [College of Music and Fine Arts](https://embap.curitiba1.unespar.edu.br/) (Belas). I really only cared about the program at Belas, whose conservatory I'd already been attending since I was 10, but my parents and my school teachers expected me to apply to UFPR because it was the most prestigious university in the city. 

I passed the exams with flying colours and enrolled in both programs simultaneously.

### UFPR

During the day, I attended UFPR. I felt impressed by my professors' credentials, most of whom had earned their terminal degrees and made a name for themselves in the US and Europe. Still, lectures were three-hour-long information dumps and the practical labs were a little too crowded to be useful. I enjoyed parts of my time at UFPR, such as socializing with like-minded people, but exams were hard and I struggled academically.

### Belas

When my day at UFPR ended, I bussed downtown to Belas, where college courses were held in the evening.

#### Video game music

My harmony instructor at Belas asked us students about our long-term goals. "I want to write music for video games," I said. Everyone chuckled, thinking I was joking. 

"Oh, you're serious...," the instructor realized. 

I was. I knew it was a viable career choice, even then. I wasn't offended by their laughing, though; my answer was unusual for the time and place and laughing was a fair reaction. Besides, I've always enjoyed making people laugh, regardless of the reason.

#### Counterpoint

Another instructor, who taught counterpoint, had us listen to and analyze Victoria's [*O magnum mysterium*](https://youtu.be/9xPh-fXYAc4?si=BvWIHRapQ_IhjSPp). 

I had **never** heard anything like that. It moved me to tears. 

I would have similar experiences later in life with the final movement of Mozart's ["Jupiter" Symphony](https://youtu.be/UsNk-7j9lpY?si=Urm8cFJn8IGiyObl&t=1588), [*Mille regretz*](https://youtu.be/dkfVzCZ68_Q?si=WMq4gcyNpIRFHNVd) by Josquin des Prez, and some of Monteverdi's [madrigals](https://youtu.be/YUgIJ212IVg?si=A0skWk9NgEqHSxVX). Come to think of it, beautiful music has made me cry much more as an adult than sadness.

#### Nightly commutes

After classes ended at about 22:30, I bussed back home with my best friend from church, who was a first-year student at Belas like me. Despite the late hour, buses were bustling with people who also had night classes in nearby colleges. It was a vibrant atmosphere, and my friend and I had some of the most fun conversations I've ever had on those commutes. 

I felt fortunate to have a friend like him, with whom I could connect deeply on many levels. Our paths would diverge in later years, and I was never to regain a friendship like that in my adult life.

I lived seven blocks away from the bus stop, and I was often accosted by aggressive stray dogs on the way home that late at night. They must've felt territorial because the streets were deserted and they were after females in heat. I soon learned that they'd leave me alone if I threw rocks at them, so I always picked up some as soon as I got off the bus. 

I had to run a few times, but I was never bitten.

## Provo-bound

Studying in two different institutions was unsustainable. Thankfully, it didn't last long. 

Many of my older cousins were attending [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/) (BYU) at the time, and my parents thought I should too. At first, I resisted the idea, but they convinced me that going abroad would give me the best chance to succeed as a musician, and I acceded.

While I was a student of UFPR and Belas, I also had to:

- Prepare for and take an English proficiency test.
- Record myself playing some piano pieces for my portfolio.
- Schedule the ecclesiastical interviews BYU required.
- Fill the application form, which included writing essays about my background and goals. 

I didn't know that the school year in the Northern Hemisphere was different than ours in Brazil, so I completed my application months after the deadline had passed. I applied so late that BYU had already sent out decision notifications by the time they received my application package.

Yet, somehow, I was admitted to start in the fall of that same year. My father maintains that this was only possible due to the intercession of an old family friend who knew someone in the admissions office. I think my father overestimates the pull this family friend had, but whatever the case, I got in.

### Naïveté

In August 2006, I quit my studies in Curitiba and went to Provo with my mother. With the help of my cousins, I rented a shared room a few blocks away from campus and my mother helped me furnish whatever little space I had. A few days later, she went back home and my solo adult life began in earnest.

That first year at BYU was very confusing. I didn't understand a whole lot about what was happening. For example, I didn't know that I had to:

- Enrol in courses by myself, taking care to avoid double-booking or conflicts with my work schedule.
- Submit a separate application to the program that I wanted to join, music theory and composition. That threw me for a loop.
- Plan how my courses would fulfill university-wide and program-specific requirements. I didn't have to worry about that in Brazil because our universities assigned all students the same course schedule.

I also didn't know any of the higher-ed lingo, e.g., undergraduate vs. graduate, and I didn't understand how these words related to my reality. What was the difference between teaching assistants (TAs), adjunct faculty, and full-time professors? I played it safe and just addressed everyone by the title of "Dr."

All I knew for certain was that my family expected me to get good marks, qualify for merit-based bursaries, find a part-time job, and leave on a mission for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/) the following year. That was the path my older cousins had blazed for me.

### My first jobs

In November, I landed my first real job ever. I worked in the cafeteria of the [Provo Missionary Training Center](https://provo.mtc.byu.edu/). My duties were straightforward: clean the kitchen and serving areas and restock chafing dishes that were running low. Despite the simplicity, I was never trained how I thought I should've been, and I often felt lost in the job. It certainly didn't help that I earned minimum wage and not a cent more.

A few months later, a cousin of mine who worked for [BYU Broadcasting](https://www.byutv.org/) got me an interview for a job as an English-Portuguese translator. Their boss offered me 25¢ above minimum wage, and I accepted without hesitation. My cousin became my supervisor and mentor for my four-month stint at that job and we often hung out together after work.

### Money stress

My student visa allowed me to work 20 weekly hours, and I worked all 20 hours every week, but money was still always tight. 

In early 2007, the little cash my mother had left me ran out, and I realized that it was hard to make my money stretch all the way to the next paycheque. I started skipping breakfast and supper and set aside an $8-10 budget for a daily midday meal. Taco Bell and Little Ceasar's gave me the best bang for my buck, and that's what I mostly ate during that first year in university.

On Sundays, I went to my aunt's after church to enjoy my only decent, home-cooked meal all week. I also visited my cousins who lived nearby during the week to scavenge their leftovers. 

With their permission, of course.

In spite of this frugal regimen, there were a few times when I ran out of money a day or two before payday. When this happened, I powered through the hunger and didn't eat until I had money again. I didn't want to keep begging for food from my cousins. (I would've used credit cards if I knew what they were.[^1])

When the cousin who worked with me found out I hadn't eaten in a while during one of these forced fasting sessions, they went to the pizza joint they side-gigged at and brought me a whole Hawaiian pizza, free of charge. Hawaiian has been my favourite kind of pizza ever since.

I haven't talked to this cousin in over a decade. There seems to have been a dispute that caused some family members to sever ties with one another, but I wasn't in Utah when that happened. I don't know what was said, I don't know who was right or wrong, but I'll always remember this estranged cousin for his kindness toward me when I was a young man.

[^1]: I did have a Best Buy credit card at the time, but I didn't know how it worked. My cousin helped me get it so I could "build my credit." I didn't know what that meant, and I only used the credit card once. I paid off the balance on the same day of the purchase and never used it again. To this day, I don't know if I could've used the card for non-Best Buy purchases.
