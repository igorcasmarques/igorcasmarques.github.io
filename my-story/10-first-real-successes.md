*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* 

## Being a young composer

Our family returned to Amherst in January 2016. There was a severe snowstorm when we arrived at the airport but our cab driver seemed unfazed by the whiteout and the low fuel warning light on his dashboard.

That winter, Vero and I had the chance to go to New York City to attend the premiere of *Suíte curitibana*, a solo bass clarinet piece that I'd written at the end of my master's. It was the first time a piece of mine had been programmed in a concert outside of a university context, i.e., the first time someone played a piece of mine because they wanted to.

We stayed at [Glen Nelson](https://www.centerforlatterdaysaintarts.org/about-main)'s apartment in Lincoln Square. Glen is a writer and a champion of artists who are members of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng) and just an extraordinary human being—worldly, urbane, generous. He and his wife came with us to the premiere.

The clarinetist did a great job, but *Suíte curitibana* didn't live up to my imagination. Still, I was happy. My music was finally being appreciated by people other than my teachers and classmates.  

### Ideal collaborations

The circumstances that led to the premiere of *Suíte curitibana* were quite organic: 

- A new music ensemble came to UB.
- They workshopped pieces by grad students, including one of mine.
- The ensemble's clarinetist and I were simpatico.
- He told me about his personal project of premiering as many solo clarinet pieces by living composers as possible.
- I told him I had a piece for solo bass clarinet that hadn't been premiered yet.
- He offered to premiere my piece.

This is how composers like to collaborate with performers: when there's goodwill and both stand to gain something. It's even better when performers are involved at the beginning of the creative process to accompany and guide the composer.

### Dilemma

For young composers in university, win-win collaborations with performers are hard to come by. University can tether us. Coursework eats up our time and directs our focus to pursuing marks rather than exploring our creativity and forming meaningful professional partnerships. 

To try and catch up, we work extra hard after hours, but even then, our work will most likely still fall short of what other very talented, well-connected, avidly self-promoting young composers are doing.

This is why young composers can be straight-A students and still fail creatively and professionally. New music is an unforgiving field. It requires 100% dedication without offering any promises of success. 

#### *Why don't young composers stop worrying about marks?*

- Good marks are necessary for bursaries, grad school applications, etc.   
- In general, composers are inquisitive and like learning all of the other things a typical university education requires.   
- Nobody enjoys performing below their capacity.

#### *Can't they just quit school then?*

- Composition is just as hard as engineering, psychology, or any other university program, so most people can't learn it without teachers and curricula and all the structure universities provide.
- The main patron of new music in the 21st century is academia and grant-giving institutions that favour academics. 

#### *So they need to be consummate professionals before finishing school?*

Correct. The quality of a composer's portfolio is what unlocks opportunities. But young composers can't populate their portfolio with good pieces if they don't have access to opportunities that yield such pieces in the first place.

#### *How do young composers overcome this chicken-and-egg situation?*

Most don't. 

They endure it while they can, then pivot their careers to composition-adjacent jobs, such as teaching piano lessons or setting up PA systems, or to corporate fields their transferrable skills might be marketable to.

## The spreadsheet 

The hopelessness of the situation had been apparent to me for years, but it was only halfway through my master's that I noticed the common denominator of successful young composers: their resumes were peppered with distinctions associated with new music events and competitions.

My teachers didn't talk much, if at all, about these events. When I brought them up, some were even derisive, calling them "beauty pageants." Yet they all proudly listed their prizes and prestigious collaborations in the program notes of their concerts. How did they expect me to get a respectable commission from, say, the [Fromm Foundation](https://frommfoundation.fas.harvard.edu/), if all I had was a barely passable portfolio?

I had to be proactive and apply, apply, apply. Festivals, conferences, competitions, calls for scores, residences. If I threw enough stuff at the wall, something was bound to stick, and when it did, things would snowball from there. God's accountant was keeping track of my hard work and would make sure I got my due eventually.

Hopefully. 

Thus, between 2014-2019, I consulted resources like the [Composer's Site](http://composerssite.com/), where opportunities for young composers to develop professionally are publicized. Each time I found an opportunity that I thought I'd be a good candidate for, I plugged it into an Excel spreadsheet.[^1] 

### First two years

In 2014, I entered 99 events in the spreadsheet and applied to 32. My success rate was 0%. But I was not discouraged; I was green and chastised myself for not doing the spreadsheet earlier.

In 2015, I entered 140 events in the spreadsheet but only applied to 14. I was busy with the transition between my master's and my PhD and had to be more selective with these applications. Just one application had a positive outcome. I was selected to a pricey new music retreat in Croatia that I ultimately could not attend because: a) Vero's mental health was deteriorating, and b) I wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway.

### And then...

In the winter of 2016, I got an email from the [Alba Rosa Viva! Festival](https://albarosavietor.com/en/). They had posted a call for new chamber pieces, which I had responded with *huithrothroy*, an evocative duo for flute and piano based on the [song of the chucao bird](https://xeno-canto.org/species/Scelorchilus-rubecula). They were now requesting a computer-made realization of *huithrothroy*. 

I thought it was odd that they'd want a computer realization of the piece; it could never make justice to an actual performance by human beings (which I didn't have because they wanted an un-premiered piece). Anyway, I sent them the audio file as requested. 

A few weeks later, Alba Rosa Viva! informed me that I had been selected as one of five finalists in the festival, and that my piece would be performed in early October 2016 in Utrecht, Netherlands. 

"It's happening!," I told Vero in excitement. "It's finally happening! I can't believe it! This is it! This is the true beginning of my career!"

## A year of hope

I got three more wins that spring:

- I was invited to attend the [Bozzini Lab](https://quatuorbozzini.ca/en/projets/bozzini_lab) in Vancouver, BC, where I'd collaborate with the [Quatuor Bozzini](https://quatuorbozzini.ca/en) in producing an experimental new piece for string quartet.
- I was accepted into [The Walden School](https://waldenschool.org/)'s week-long [Creative Musicians Retreat](https://waldenschool.org/creative-musicians-retreat/) in New Hampshire, where I would meet dozens of composers, performers, improvisers, choral directors, etc.
- *Interlude (Between Bite and Kiss)*, a duo for guitar and left-hand piano inspired by the incredible work of [Alex Caldiero](https://thesonosopher.com/caldiero-vita), won a call for scores by a Japanese publisher, and it would be premiered later that year in Kyoto.

I also participated in the [June in Buffalo](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/music21c/june-in-buffalo.html) festival in 2016, which I was entitled to attend as a PhD student at UB.

### Vero's aunts

Vero had three aunts visit us in Amherst in the summer. None of them had ever been to the US. It was an adventure for them and for us. Vero took them to New York City and the [Sacred Grove](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/locations/sacred-grove?lang=eng), then came home a few days before I had to leave for the Creative Musicians Retreat.  

The Retreat had a fun structure: 

- Day: Lessons, rehearsals, workshops, discussions, and hikes 
- Evening: Concerts with discussion panels 

Multi-Grammy® winner [Michael Daugherty](https://smtd.umich.edu/profiles/michael-daugherty/) was the composer-in-residence at the Retreat that year and led the discussion panels in the evening concerts. After my piece was played, he said,

"What kind of torture are the likes of you and Haas trying to inflict on us?"

It was just banter. The audience laughed, the performers laughed, but the biggest grin was my own—I **loved** being mentioned in the same breath as the legendary [Georg Friedrich Haas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Friedrich_Haas).

### Trip to the Netherlands

In late September, I went to Utrecht via the now defunct [WOW Air](https://wowair.com/). The airfare was cheap, but it had a catch: there was a day-long stopover in Reykjavík between Toronto and Amsterdam. Since I'd long been fascinated with [Iceland and Vikings](/my-story/8-graduation-u-of-u.md#its-all-done), the stopover was a plus for me.

#### Reykjavík

The flight to Iceland was a red-eye. When we were near Greenland, a flight attendant announced that the aurora borealis was visible from my side of the airplane. I was tired and my eyes hurt, but seeing the aurora was still magical.

We arrived in Iceland before sunrise. When I boarded the shuttle from the airport to the city, the driver said, "Good morning," in English. I greeted her in Icelandic and she immediately switched to Icelandic. I must've sounded convincing enough, but that's all I had learned: greetings. She then asked me a question, I confessed I didn't actually speak Icelandic, she looked annoyed, and switched back to English. 

"Where are you going?" She repeated herself in a language I could understand.

"Erm... Reykjavík?", I replied.

"Yes, but *where* in Reykjavík?" 

She was exasperated. It was early, I had tricked her about my Icelandic proficiency, and now I was holding up the queue. I couldn't give her a definitive answer, so I just went all the way to the final stop. It was close to the iconic [Hallsgrímskirkja](https://www.hallgrimskirkja.is/en), so it worked out well.

I walked everywhere in Reykjavík and had a great time. How could a world capital be so quaint. My brief stopover also coincided with the first of the [Nordic Music Days](https://nordicmusicdays.org/), a new music festival, so I attended that evening's events at [Harpa Concert Hall](https://www.harpa.is/en/).

#### Utrecht

When I finally made it to the Netherlands, I spent a couple of hours exploring Amsterdam before going to my Airbnb in Vleuten, a few km from Utrecht's city centre. The following couple of days were filled with rehearsals, stroopwafel, shawarma, and getting to know the other finalists and the competition's organizers. 

The concert that featured the works of all finalists took place in a cathedral. Everything looked and sounded beautiful. Much to my surprise, *huithrothroy* placed 2nd in the competition. I was eating hors-d'œuvre with the performers when someone came looking for me to tell me I'd won something. I swallowed quickly and jogged to the stage to receive the prize. 

## Happy sigh

Professionally, 2016 was a great year for me. My work on the spreadsheet was starting to pay off after more than two years of zero success.

And I had good reason to believe that 2017 was going to be good too. The peerless [Arditti Quartet](https://ardittiquartet.com/) was coming to Buffalo in the winter—and they were going to record one of my pieces. 

I couldn't wait.
