From Curitiba to Valdivia</h1></header><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="uach-year-1">UACh (Year 1)<a href="#uach-year-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UACh (Year 1)" title="Direct link to UACh (Year 1)">​</a></h2>
<p>In early 2021, I was hired as <em>Profesor Auxiliar</em> at <a href="https://www.uach.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UACh</a>&#x27;s <a href="https://arquitectura-artes.uach.cl/escuela-de-artes-musicales-y-sonoras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Music and Sound Arts</a>. I was offered a one-year contract with the possibility of renewal pending a positive performance review and a unanimous vote by my fellow faculty members. On the third renewal, my contract would be made indeterminate.</p>
<p>Tenure track, essentially. This was the equivalent of a tenure-track job in one of Chile&#x27;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Traditional_Universities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditional universities</a>. A stable and promising position in academia, a mirage that I&#x27;d been pursuing for so long, had suddenly become a reality.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s more, this career opportunity would also help my wife feel happier. When we were in the US, Vero often expressed how much she missed living in Chile, being close to her family, and working as a dentist. Chile is where she felt like her truest self.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concepción">Concepción<a href="#concepción" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concepción" title="Direct link to Concepción">​</a></h3>
<p>UACh was not holding any in-person classes then due to COVID-related restrictions, so we decided that our family should stay in Curitiba while I worked for UACh. It made economic sense. Our expenses in Brazil were minimal, and the exchange rate between Chilean pesos and reais favoured us.</p>
<p>However, I still needed to get a work permit, ID, and bank account in Chile, so I travelled solo to Concepción in February to stayed with my in-laws while I waited for Migraciones and Registro Civil to process my paperwork. As soon as I got what I needed, I went back to Curitiba.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="curitiba">Curitiba<a href="#curitiba" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Curitiba" title="Direct link to Curitiba">​</a></h3>
<p>Apartments in Brazil typically have a &quot;service area&quot; with the hookups for laundry appliances, a large sink with a built-in washboard called <em>tanque</em>, and a bathroom. Occasionally, service areas also have a small room that people use as a pantry or as a simple bedroom for live-in maids.</p>
<p>The service area in our apartment in Curitiba had such a room, and we used it as Elias&#x27;s bedroom. It had a crib, a lamp, a white noise machine, a smart camera, and a space heater for cold nights. It was bare, but he slept well there.</p>
<p>When I got the job at UACh, we sold Elias&#x27;s crib and put him to sleep in a trundle bed in Samuel&#x27;s bedroom—like my brother and I had done when we were kids—so I could set up an office in the service area room. I kept the lamp, added a cheap folding table as my desk, and secluded myself there every day as I taught music courses via Zoom.</p>
<p>My work arrangement suited me. I worked hard, I taught my students with care, and I composed and recorded several new works. I even released an <a href="https://igorcoelhoasmarques.bandcamp.com/album/glosolalia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended play</a>.</p>
<p>When I got off work, I spent time with Vero and the boys visiting my parents or taking strolls around our neighbourhood. I enjoyed being a part of that community, where there was a grocer, a baker, a barber, a butcher, and other people who knew me and on whom I could rely for our everyday needs. There was even an <em>itamae</em> three blocks from our place who made the best sushi I&#x27;ve ever had anywhere!<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I think that if I could&#x27;ve kept working in Chile indefinitely while living in Brazil, we might&#x27;ve dropped the idea of going to Canada altogether.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="linares">Linares<a href="#linares" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Linares" title="Direct link to Linares">​</a></h3>
<p>Yet, working in a country and living in another is not really possible without dual citizenship and people willing to run errands for you on the other side. We knew our time in Curitiba was running out, but it wasn&#x27;t clear how soon UACh would return to in-person classes.</p>
<p>When I heard rumblings that in-person activities at UACh might resume in the spring (September-December), Vero and I pre-emptively booked our family&#x27;s tickets to Chile. Her sister Karina lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linares,_Chile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linares</a>, a medium-sized town in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maule_Region" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maule Region</a>, and offered to share her house with us while we waited for UACh to make an official announcement.</p>
<p>If UACh reinstated in-person classes, we&#x27;d already be in Chile, and thus ready to move to Valdivia. If they didn&#x27;t, we&#x27;d visit Vero&#x27;s family in Linares and Concepción and then go back to Brazil. Either way, our family was looking forward to spending the week-long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiestas_Patrias_(Chile)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fiestas Patrias</em> holidays</a> with Vero&#x27;s family, something she&#x27;d been wanting to do since she <a href="/my-story/graduation-byu#veros-graduation">left Chile</a> in 2012.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="working-from-not-my-home">Working from (not my) home<a href="#working-from-not-my-home" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Working from (not my) home" title="Direct link to Working from (not my) home">​</a></h4>
<p>Karina, her husband, and their two children were the most wonderful and patient hosts. Being with them was always pleasant, and I enjoyed our evenings together in particular, when we chatted, ate take-out, and solved jigsaw puzzles.</p>
<p>Karina&#x27;s family ceded a room upstairs for me to use as an ad-hoc office. The room looked east and had a large window, so I could see the snowy Andes from there on a clear day. Every dusk, I also saw dozens of Chilean swallows swooping up and down in the air and feeding in the little park across the street.</p>
<p>You couldn&#x27;t beat my office view.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="paso-pehuenche">Paso Pehuenche<a href="#paso-pehuenche" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Paso Pehuenche" title="Direct link to Paso Pehuenche">​</a></h4>
<p>The highlight of our trip to Linares was going with all of Vero&#x27;s family to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paso_Pehuenche" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paso Pehuenche</a>, an Andean pass that leads to Argentina. We had a picnic by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maule_River" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maule river</a> and then went up the mountain as far as the road would take us and parked right before the international border crossing.</p>
<p>Samuel and I hiked up a nearby ridge, away from the people playing in the snow near the road. When we made it to the top, the majesty of the Andes overwhelmed me. It was beautiful beyond words.</p>
<p>So what did we do to mark this special moment?</p>
<p>We peed.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. He wanted to go, I wanted to go, there was absolutely nobody around, so I told him, &quot;Let&#x27;s just do it here. Just aim toward Argentina, maybe the wind will take your pee all the way over there!&quot; He laughed so hard he nearly peed himself before he could pee on the Andes.</p>
<p>To this day I&#x27;ll sometimes ask Samuel, &quot;Remember when we <em>peed</em> on the Andes? That was wild!&quot; He acts like he doesn&#x27;t remember it, though.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="christmas">Christmas<a href="#christmas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Christmas" title="Direct link to Christmas">​</a></h3>
<p>Several weeks into our stay in Linares, UACh confirmed that in-person classes would only return in 2022, so we flew back to Curitiba in October. We then spent our last months in Brazil getting ready for the holidays and for our imminent move to Valdivia shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>That Christmas, I made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%C3%B3_de_Nadal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>tió de Nadal</em></a> for Samuel and Elias, a silly Catalan tradition where an anthropomorphized log poops out presents for kids. When Samuel saw that the tió had pooped a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch</a> during our Christmas Eve party, he screamed in happiness and started freaking out, much like I&#x27;d done when I&#x27;d gotten my Nintendo 64 a quarter of a century earlier. Elias didn&#x27;t quite understand what was going on, but he was happy to share in his brother&#x27;s excitement.</p>
<p>Our family has loved playing the Switch ever since.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="10th-anniversary">10th anniversary<a href="#10th-anniversary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 10th anniversary" title="Direct link to 10th anniversary">​</a></h2>
<p>In late 2021, between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s, Vero and I celebrated our 10th anniversary—our <em>family birthday</em>, as Vero&#x27;s called it since Samuel was born. I wanted an unforgettable celebration for this special milestone, so I asked my mother to watch the boys for a couple of days while Vero and I went to Ponta Grossa, about 120 km west of Curitiba.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="buraco-do-padre">Buraco do Padre<a href="#buraco-do-padre" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Buraco do Padre" title="Direct link to Buraco do Padre">​</a></h3>
<p>We visited two geological sites near Ponta Grossa: <a href="https://parquevilavelha.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vila Velha State Park</a> with its towering rock formations and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campos_Gerais_National_Park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Campos Gerais National Park</a>, which had slot canyons and a cave with a 40 m-tall skylight and its own waterfall called <a href="https://buracodopadre.com.br/atracao/furna-buraco-do-padre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buraco do Padre</em></a> (&quot;The Priest&#x27;s Hole&quot;).<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>People call Buraco do Padre an &quot;underground amphitheatre&quot; because the shallow pool created by the waterfall is surrounded by large rocks where people can sit and observe the hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscutate_swift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biscutate swifts</a> flying to and from their nests in the crevices of the cave walls. I was awestruck by the din they made. Then, when we waded in the shallow pool, fresh-water crustaceans skittered around our feet.</p>
<p>It was glorious.</p>

<p>In early 2022, we left Brazil for good. It was our second big, life-changing, international move in a little over a year. I was tired but motivated by my work at UACh and Vero&#x27;s excitement.</p>
