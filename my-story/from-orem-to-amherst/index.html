<p>I arrived in Utah in late July 2015, while Vero and Samuel stayed behind in Chiguayante. My brother and a cousin of ours helped me put my family&#x27;s stuff in a small container for a moving company to haul across the country for us, and I began the 3,100-km journey to Amherst on our beloved hatchback, a 2011 Nissan Versa.</p>

<p>People romanticize road trips. Not me.</p>
<p>Growing up, my parents took my siblings and me on many long road trips, especially to visit my grandparents who lived in Rio de Janeiro and GoiÃ¢nia, 10 and 12 hours away from Curitiba, respectively. If I tried to read a book or do crossword puzzles, I got carsick. If I rested my head against the window, my parents scolded me.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s too dangerous,&quot; they said. &quot;In the event of a car crash, you&#x27;d die instantly.&quot;<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Music helped with the boredom whenever decent radio stations were available. Sometimes we also played silly games to pass the time, like finding vehicles of a certain colour, but these games got old pretty quick. And then there was nothing to do but sit upright, wait until I got tired enough to sleep, then hope that by the time I woke up we would have arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>My parents and my sister reminisce about these road trips with fondness. They&#x27;re some of their most treasured memories. I guess our perception is different.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="road-trip-rating-scale">Road trip rating scale<a href="#road-trip-rating-scale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Road trip rating scale" title="Direct link to Road trip rating scale">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>As an adult, travelling with Vero helped me get over my hang-ups about road trips. I still try to avoid them, but when they&#x27;re unavoidableâ€”Vero insists on going to new placesâ€”I&#x27;ve figured out how I can make them bearable and, dare I say, even fun.</p>
<p>Good road trips are characterized by six factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependable roads</li>
<li>Beautiful and/or varied scenery</li>
<li>Comfortable stops that divide the trip into manageable chunks</li>
<li>Enjoyable company</li>
<li>Exciting destination</li>
<li>Onboard entertainment</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite being the longest road trip of my life by far, my journey from Orem, UT to Amherst, NY scored 6/6 in my rating scale.</p>

<p>This cross-country road trip was a sort of rite of passage that marked the end of my young adulthood. When I arrived in Amherst, I thought of my father, who had done so many business trips by car in Brazil that there was not a single obscure town people mentioned to him that he had not driven by.</p>
<p>And now I felt like I belonged in his league.</p>

<p>A few days later, Vero and Samuel flew from ConcepciÃ³n to Buffalo, with stops in Santiago and New York. When I picked them up at the airport, they were uncomfortable and sleep-deprived and their clothes were soiled with vomit.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> I regretted not having been there to support them. I thanked Vero, gave her and Samuel long hugs, and brought them to our new home in the hamlet of Snyder.</p>
<p>Our new home was a small apartment on the second floor of a 1950s fourplex. The apartment had two bedrooms and one bathroom and we did our laundry in the basement with card-operated machines we shared with the residents of the other three apartments. Our apartment wasn&#x27;t much, but it was sufficient for our needs and it was located on a neighbourhood with lots of trees and parks adjacent some 5 km from campus.</p>
<p>We spent the next four years in that apartment, and shared some of the happiest times we&#x27;ve ever had as a family there.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ub-year-1">UB (Year 1)<a href="#ub-year-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UB (Year 1)" title="Direct link to UB (Year 1)">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>My classes started around Labour Day.</p>
<p>When I was assigned to have composition lessons with <a href="http://www.jeffreystadelman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Stadelman</a>, I couldn&#x27;t help but feel slighted by Felder, who had seemed so eager to have me as his student when we talked before.</p>
<p>I did my best to take it in stride and Stadelman turned out to be a good teacher. He was calm and pensive, an interesting contrast with his towering height of over 200 cm. We met weekly until the spring of 2016, at which point he retired. I believe I was his last composition student at UB.</p>
<p>That first semester at UB, I taught a course on Brazilian music that I created from scratch. Unfortunately, it failed to attract many enrollees, so the following term the Music Department put me in charge of a section of MUS 116, an introductory course of music theory for non-musicians with consistently high enrolment rates.</p>
<p>I grew to love MUS 116, and taught it seven more times until I left UB in 2020.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="immigration-issues">Immigration issues<a href="#immigration-issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Immigration issues" title="Direct link to Immigration issues">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>A week after my classes started at UB, I noticed that my US visa was about to expire.</p>
<p>I was terrified of overstaying my visa because I thought it would jeopardize my studies. I couldn&#x27;t find any information about renewing my visa online, so I figured I had to talk to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) directly. Lucky for me, Buffalo is a major city on an international border, so there were four CBP offices I could go to and ask for help in person.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-time-in-canada"><del>First time in Canada</del><a href="#first-time-in-canada" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to first-time-in-canada" title="Direct link to first-time-in-canada">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>One morning, I put the address of the Peace Bridge CBP office on Google Maps and started driving. When I got to the bridge, I crossed it. I just crossed it. I kept thinking the CBP office was just a little further, just a little further ... until I made it past the point of no return, past the &quot;Welcome to Canada&quot; sign.</p>
<p>I sat in the line to enter Canada for a long time, wondering what I should tell the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer to get out of that messy situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, bonjour&quot; is how all CBSA officers greet people.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh ... yes, sorry, I entered Canada by mistake,&quot; I said, rather pathetically.</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I was looking for the American customs office when I took a wrong turn, and now I&#x27;m here. I mean, this must happen all the time, right? People crossing by mistake, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not really. Do you have a passport?&quot;</p>
<p>I did, but Brazilian nationals couldn&#x27;t enter Canada without a visa. And I did not have a Canadian visa.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;m sorry, bud, but we&#x27;re gonna have to deny you entry to Canada and send you back to the US.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I understand.&quot; I felt really stupid.</p>
<p>The CBSA officer instructed me to go to the Canadian border crossing office, where, after waiting for almost an hour, I explained the whole situation to a second officer, who was just as puzzled as the first one. Then I got a big red stamp on my passport, crossed the Peace Bridge back, explained my dumb mistake for the third time, and drove back home, defeated.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-visas">About visas<a href="#about-visas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About visas" title="Direct link to About visas">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Later that week, I was able to talk to a CBP agent on the phone, and I realized I was even dumber than I thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Visas are entry documents,&quot; he explained. &quot;Their only purpose is to grant you access to the country. This is why you couldn&#x27;t find anything online about renewing your visa here in America. Because you can only renew visas in foreign countries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once inside the country, what determines how long you can stay in the country is your immigration status, which for  F-1 students like you, appears on your I-20 form. Do you see the date on your I-20?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it says it&#x27;s valid until June 2019,&quot; I answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Well then, you have nothing to worry about for now,&quot; he assured me. &quot;As long as the date on the I-20 is valid, your visa can expire and there&#x27;s nothing illegal about it. Your I-20 is what really matters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you really want to renew your F-1 visa, though, you first have to leave America. Like, you can just go to Canada and do it in an American consulate there.&quot; I just needed to make sure I got a Canadian visa first.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="second-time-in-canada"><del>Second time in Canada</del><a href="#second-time-in-canada" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to second-time-in-canada" title="Direct link to second-time-in-canada">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>My mother-in-law wanted to visit us in the fall of 2015. She could use a break from her routine in Chile and Vero could use the help, so she bought a ticket from Santiago to Torontoâ€”it was more cost-effective than coming to Buffalo and still within a reasonable driving distance.</p>
<p>I had learned my lesson. I wanted to pick her up at Toronto Pearson so I applied to a visa to Canada.</p>
<p>I figured that since I was driving in and out of Canada in the span of a few hours, I only needed a &quot;transit&quot; visa. I wasn&#x27;t going to <em>stay</em> in the country, I wasn&#x27;t even going to <em>visit</em> the country, I was just <em>transiting</em> through the country.</p>
<p>My visa request was denied. Why? Because &quot;transit&quot; visas are for passengers in connecting flights, and the right visa for me should have been just the good old &quot;tourist&quot; visa.</p>
<p>For someone who had lived abroad for nine years, I sure knew very little about immigration processes. Thankfully, Chilean nationals did not need a visa to enter Canada, so Vero ended up picking up her mother at the airport.</p>

<p>We went back to Utah to attend my brother&#x27;s wedding in Logan and spend Christmas at my sister&#x27;s, who had recently moved with her husband into a spacious townhouse in Orem. My parents were there as well and we all had a great time together.</p>
<p>One day, a cousin of mine and his wife came to my sister&#x27;s place. My brother-in-law had a PlayStation 3 in the basement hooked up to all of the gear we needed to play <em>Guitar Hero</em> with a group of people, so we went down there. Since I was going to sing, I chose the song: <a href="https://youtu.be/o0RE230PlX4?si=vOtEUUpGEtn4mI-M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; by Ozzy Osbourne</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; has a long synthesizer intro, so I improvised a spoken introduction on the microphone. I&#x27;d heard the song so many times as a teenager that I knew the intro by heart, so I rambled on and on about darkness and occultism, and ended with something like &quot;Please welcome to the stage: SATAN!&quot; right before Ozzy sang, &quot;Miiiiister Crooow-leeeey.&quot;</p>
<p>My timing and delivery were so on point that my sister, my brother-in-law, my cousin and his wife Vero all burst laughing. They were guffawing so much that we couldn&#x27;t even play the game anymore. To this day, they tell me it was one of the funniest moments of their lives, which automatically makes it one of the proudest moments of mine.</p>
