<p>After I was honourably released from my mission in May 2009, I met with <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/leader/richard-g-scott?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elder Richard Scott</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/quorum-of-the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quorum of Twelve Apostles</a>. Among other things, he told me that my next priority should be finding an &quot;eternal companion.&quot;</p>
<p>My mind went to Vero.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-kiss">First kiss<a href="#first-kiss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First kiss" title="Direct link to First kiss">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Vero had broken up with her previous boyfriend some time before I came back home and agreed to go to Curitiba to be with me in the four months I had between finishing my mission and resuming my studies at BYU. We wanted to see if we were as compatible in person as we were in writing, and if it&#x27;d be worth committing to a long-distance relationship.</p>
<p>We were. Vero and I clicked instantly.</p>
<p>We had fun getting to know each other and going to Curitiba&#x27;s tourist destinations. She smelled good and I liked the way she spoke Spanish. I even serenaded her with a song I&#x27;d written on the piano.</p>
<p>When we were in line at a fast food joint, I hugged Vero from behind, she turned her face around, and we kissed for the first time. I still get butterflies in my stomach thinking about that moment.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pololeo">Pololeo<a href="#pololeo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pololeo" title="Direct link to Pololeo">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>After Vero and I had spent some time together in Curitiba, I realized I&#x27;d fallen in love with her. I wanted to tell her how I felt but I was embarrassed to do it, so every now and again I&#x27;d spell out words on the palm of her hand with my index finger, Helen Keller-style, to express my feelings.</p>
<p>One day, we found ourselves in the back of my parents&#x27; car on a long road trip. I took her hand and asked her, &quot;Will you be my girlfriend?,&quot; using my tactile writing system.</p>
<p>She said no; she wanted me to ask her out loud and in a more appropriate setting.</p>
<p>A few days later, we went to a nice Mexican restaurant and I asked her to be my girlfriend again, this time out loud, and she said yes. We agreed the connection we felt was worth nurturing in a long-distance relationship while we were both in university, and I promised to do my best to visit her in Chile at least once a year.</p>

<p>My parents loved Vero and were supportive of our committed relationship.</p>
<p>After Vero left Curitiba and went back home, my father told me he&#x27;d cover the cost of an airfare to ConcepciÃ³n, Vero&#x27;s hometown, so I could see her again before going to Provo. I went, met Vero&#x27;s family and friends, and fell more in love with her.</p>

<p>When I finally made it to Provo a few months later, I landed a job interview at <a href="https://www.classical89.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classical 89 (KBYU-FM)</a>, the university&#x27;s classical music radio station. It was the perfect fit for me.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interview">Interview<a href="#interview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interview" title="Direct link to Interview">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>The interview was a bit more intense than I expected. At one point, one of the interviewers asked me if I was able to tell who the conductor and orchestra were just by listening to a recording.</p>
<p>No way. Not even nowadays.</p>
<p>He said he could. It was not a weird power move, though; he was a nice guy and hoped to bond with me by nerding out together. Overall, the interviewers wanted to make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was passionate about classical music.</li>
<li>I could write &quot;my way out of a paper bag.&quot;</li>
<li>I had a good voice for radio.</li>
</ul>
<p>I checked the first two out of these three boxes; my accent and lack of experience got in the way of the third. Nevertheless, they saw my potential and offered me the job.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="job-duties">Job duties<a href="#job-duties" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Job duties" title="Direct link to Job duties">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>The people who hired me at Classical 89 gave me the title of <em>assistant producer</em> and told me that that was not the position that I had applied forâ€”that had gone to another young manâ€”but that they&#x27;d liked me and wanted to keep me because another student was going to graduate soon anyway.</p>
<p>My main tasks as an assistant producer were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assisting with the logistics of concert recordings</li>
<li>Editing and packaging interviews and live performances for the air</li>
<li>Supporting the full-time announcers in their shifts</li>
<li>Pre-recording shifts that would air on weekday evenings and weekends</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;d always chosen my words carefully because I hated being misunderstood as a child, and working at Classical 89 helped me elevate that personality trait into communicative power. I learned a lot by reading what I&#x27;d written aloud and then revising it until it sounded good enough to say it on the air.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crisis-of-self-awareness">Crisis of self-awareness<a href="#crisis-of-self-awareness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Crisis of self-awareness" title="Direct link to Crisis of self-awareness">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>One day, I checked out a portable Zoom recorder at work. Strangely, I noticed that the recorder&#x27;s storage was almost full, even though people used to format the recorders after using them and before checking them back in.</p>
<p>I listened to the recording to find out who&#x27;d made it so I could ask for their permission to clear the recorder&#x27;s memory and use the recorder for my project.</p>
<p>I heard the voice of the young man who&#x27;d gotten the position I&#x27;d applied for. I&#x27;d been working with him for several months and I thought he was a nice guy. He was interviewing his wife in the recording, apparently as a joke to test the equipment. It piqued my curiosity, so I listened on.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, he began to role-play as me in the recording. He put on a thick accent and started acting stupid. In his role-play, he, or rather, <em>I</em> was courting his wife like a jackass while she laughed and refused my advances.</p>
<p>I thought it was weird that she acted like she knew who I was, even though we&#x27;d never exchanged more than a couple of words. Was I the person that couple liked gossiping about? Were there other people who thought I was like that, a creepy idiot?</p>
<p>I stopped the recording and deleted the file. I was so perplexed that I couldn&#x27;t keep listening. Maybe that parody of me was a truer version of myself than the person I thought I was.</p>
<p>How rare and fleeting self-awareness can be. The person I think I am, the person others perceive me to be, and the person I really am, may as well be three different people.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2009, one of Vero&#x27;s friends moved from ConcepciÃ³n to Provo. I&#x27;d met her in Chile and thought she was great fun, so we got together once or twice after her move to Provo.</p>
<p>On Saturday, 27 February 2010, she called me in the morning.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="27f">27F<a href="#27f" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 27F" title="Direct link to 27F">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>&quot;Have you had any news from Vero?&quot; Her voice wavered with a hint of desperation. &quot;I can&#x27;t get in touch with my family!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why? What&#x27;s wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You haven&#x27;t heard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heard what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Chile_earthquake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive earthquake near Conce</a>, one of the worst ones ever! And a tsunami, too. Phone lines are down, internet&#x27;s down, nothing&#x27;s working, so nobody knows if people there are OK.&quot;</p>
<p>We commiserated with each other and tried calling, emailing, using social media, anything to reach the people we loved down there. Over the course of that weekend, she was able to talk to her family, and I got a call from Vero, who apparently had borrowed a satellite phone.</p>
<p>Vero told me that the earthquake had been vicious, but that her family was OK and their home appeared to have suffered no structural damage. Life was complicated with severe aftershocks, looting, damaged roads, and a lack of services, and they were traumatized and constantly on edge but safe. Vero told me not to worry, then hung up.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Chileans are proud of their resilience and the country gradually resumed activities in the following weeks, even though many people continued to struggle for years with the after-effects of 27F.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="world-cup">World Cup<a href="#world-cup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to World Cup" title="Direct link to World Cup">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Two months after the earthquake, I travelled to Chile. I was impressed by the ruins of the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edificio_Alto_R%C3%ADo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alto RÃ­o</a>, a 15-storey building near the BiobÃ­o river that broke in half and collapsed during the earthquake. An <a href="https://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/atanacio-soza-arquitectos-memorial-27f-a-potential-symbol-of-drastic-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imposing but controversial memorial</a> was erected near the site of the Alto RÃ­o in 2013.</p>
<p>I also noticed that 27F had become a scapegoat for problems that clearly antedated it, so I started joking with Vero and blaming 27F for any minor inconvenience I had.</p>
<p>2010 was a World Cup year as well, and Chileans were excited about the prospects of their national team. The Chilean squad did very well in the tournament until they had to go against Brazil in the round of 16, at which point they were properly thrashed, 3-0. That could&#x27;ve caused some friction with my girlfriend, but she was as Brazilian as she was Chilean, and felt comfortable with whatever outcome of that match.</p>

<p>Fall 2010 marked the beginning of my third year in university. Academically, I was doing very well and had qualified for two simultaneous full-tuition scholarships.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alma">ALMA<a href="#alma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ALMA" title="Direct link to ALMA">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Whenever I wasn&#x27;t in class or at work, one could find me in the <a href="https://music.byu.edu/facilities/electronic-facilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Lab for Music Applications</a> (ALMA) in BYU&#x27;s Harris Fine Arts Center (HFAC). Located in a weird annex of the HFAC away from heavy foot traffic and furnished with row after row of MIDI keyboards and audio workstations, the ALMA became a sort of sanctuary for me.</p>
<p>I thought back to my reticence about applying to BYU, and the ALMA made me feel grateful for my parents&#x27; insistence.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="move-to-orem">Move to Orem<a href="#move-to-orem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Move to Orem" title="Direct link to Move to Orem">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>In late 2010, my parents decided to spend a small fortune they had been saving to buy a condo in Orem near exit 273 of the I-15. It had high ceilings, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a nice balcony with a view of the <a href="https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/parks-outdoors/wasatch-mountains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasatch Mountains</a>. It was a couple of blocks away from <a href="https://www.wincofoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WinCo</a>, my favourite grocery store ever, and about 5 km away from scenic <a href="https://utahlake.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Utah Lake</a>.</p>
<p>That condo would be my home until 2015. I loved living there and never took it for granted.</p>
<p>As 2011 rolled around, life was going well. I continued to excel in university, I loved my job and my condo, and I had all the support I needed to feel stable and happy. I talked to Vero every night, which was no replacement for us being <em>physically</em> together, but was enough to carry me over until next summer.</p>
<p>Still, I began to sense a new spectre nearby: my quarter-life crisis.</p>
