*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) and [portfolio](/docs/portfolio/intro) in different areas of this site.* 

## Time for a PhD

Only three of the 10 doctoral programs I applied to advanced me to the next round in the application process: the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/academics/music/composition-ma-phd/) (UCLA); the [Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/music/curriculum-and-degree-information/composition-concentration) (CUNY); and the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/programs/music-composition-phd.html) (UB).

### UCLA

UCLA had me travel to Los Angeles to "audition" for them. 

After taking a test on music theory and history, I sat down for an interview with the graduate admissions committee of the School of Music. They grilled me on aural skills and some more theory. At one point, after I said I liked [Webern's Symphony](https://youtu.be/Xq2gwuKDPnY?si=kG_G3iJ8Z9c_eA09), a senior member of the committee asked me if I had memorized P0, an arbitrary series of twelve notes in the Symphony's first movement, and whether I could explain its permutations in the exposition.

I couldn't. He could. 

He had been teaching a graduate seminar about it for years and years. I hadn't.

Toward the end of the interview, a young faculty member wanted to discuss one of the pieces in my portfolio, an orchestral work titled *Purple Robe*. I wrote it for the [BYU Philharmonic](https://pam.byu.edu/ensembles/philharmonic-orchestra/) two years prior, while I was still an undergraduate student. 

*Purple Robe* starts out as a thicket of uncoordinated and repetitive noise that gradually gives way to a baroque vocalise. It's very expressive. The part I like the best is the transition between the last bit of noise and the vocalise, which features straight-up clapping by the orchestra's percussionists. It's ridiculously simple but it gives me goosebumps.

I didn't impress the UCLA committee enough to get a spot in the program and they wait-listed me, which was just as well because they hadn't exactly passed my vibe check either. I found the people there to be as stuffy as the weather that day, and LA traffic was purgatorial.

### CUNY

I was excited for my interview at CUNY. I liked the idea of living in New York City and studying with [Jason Eckardt](https://www.jasoneckardt.com/), a composer I looked up to a lot. 

CUNY's committee interviewed me over Skype. They were unaffected and patient and put me much more at ease than the UCLA people did. I thought New Yorkers were supposed to be curt and short-tempered and Angelinos were laid-back, not the other way around.

I put my foot in my mouth a few times in the CUNY interview. I made a political joke that totally bombed. When they asked me about my interests, i.e., my *research* interests, I said I liked archaeomusicology (which I knew nothing about) and "walks on the beach." Yikes.

CUNY also wait-listed me.

### UB

Between my interviews at UCLA and CUNY, I got a phone call from composer [David Felder](http://www.david-felder.com/). During his 30-year tenure at UB, Felder had amassed an impressive catalogue of prize-winning original works and prestigious commissions and collaborations. His professional network was second to none. Felder was also the founder and director of the [Center for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Music](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/music21c.html), which brought new music superstars from all over the world to Buffalo throughout the year and especially in the summer during the [June in Buffalo](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/music21c/june-in-buffalo.html) conference. 

There was no admissions committee at UB. Felder called the shots. 

He and I were on the phone for half an hour, and like [Rosenzweig](https://morrisrosenzweig.com/bio) at the U, he believed in me much more than I did. He told me about how often I'd be able to work with first-rate composers and ensembles, name-dropped a few illustrious alumni of the program, and then he sweetened the deal by saying that I would get a [Presidential Scholarship](https://www.buffalo.edu/honors/funding-aid/prospective-students.html) on top of my full-tuition waiver and my teaching assistantship.

I was sold. I thanked UCLA and CUNY for considering my application and asked them to remove me from their wait lists.

## Chile between degrees

After I finished my master's in the spring of '15, our family flew down to Chile to be with Vero's family in Chiguayante until we had to move to Buffalo in the fall. Vero's parents lived in a house west of Manuel Rodríguez, Chiguayante's main thoroughfare, between a Unimarc grocery store and the town's train tracks. It also had a nice view of the Manquimávida hill.

### Routine

Vero's mood improved by being in familiar places with her loved ones, and we settled into a routine. Samuel woke up very early, between 5-6 a.m., and had breakfast with my mother-in-law while Vero and I slept in. When we woke up, we took over his care, watching *Thomas the Tank Engine* on his tablet and playing with his toy trains until *almuerzo*, our main meal at midday. 

I still love *Thomas* and I get a lump in my throat when I watch clips of the old episodes with Ringo Starr and George Carlin because they send me back to that trip and all the one-on-one time I shared with my son.

### Wintertime

I also took Samuel out for walks around the neighbourhood whenever he was bored or fussy, which ended up happening once or twice a day.

We sometimes crossed paths with nosy ladies who were horrified that I'd be out and about with a toddler in the middle of winter. To them (and to most people I met in southern Chile), winter was something to hide from and endlessly whine about. 

I think they act this way because winters in southern Chile are on a liminal zone between not cold enough for snow, which would be aesthetic, and not mild enough to be easily ignored—temperatures in Concepción hover between 5°C and 15°C. This in-betweenness and people's lack of resources have created a building culture that has largely eschewed proper insulation and central heating in favour of space heaters powered by liquefied gas or kerosene.[^1]

And blankets. Lots and lots of blankets.

But step away from the 3-m radius around the heater, and the rest of the house feels like the inside of a refrigerator, cold and damp. In fact, sometimes it feels colder inside a house than outside—which is one of the reasons Samuel and I went on walks!

### Family history

After Samuel ate his *almuerzo*, I put him down for a nap. With luck, he'd sleep for a couple of hours, which which gave me time to engage in my favourite pastime in my twenties: researching my family history. 

I'd wanted to know who my ancestors were from a very young age. I think it's a tantalizing hobby for people like me who feel they're too different from their parents because we hope to find the key to understanding why we are the way we are hidden deep in our ancestry.

It's hard to explain, but I've always felt a powerful call.

#### "It's all done"

Because of my my blue eyes, I used to fantasize that my ancestors were Viking warriors or Celtic druids. Never mind that my father had repeatedly said that we were Portuguese because my mother already done all the work and traced our origins all the way until the paper trail died in the 1300s.

That much is true. My mother indeed descends from minor nobility with deep, deep roots in northern Portugal—obviously not Vikings, but maybe descendants of Celts after all. They arrived in Brazil during the gold rush of the 1700s, and were influential landowners and key players in the local politics of southern Minas Gerais at the time. They also owned slaves, by the way, as [that man in Egg Harbor City](/my-story/3-mission-year-two.md#confrontation) had guessed.

But that was just one branch of my family tree. There was so much more that we did not know.

#### Avanca

For instance, we knew nothing of my father's paternal grandparents other than their names and likely origins: Bernardino from Portugal and Anna from Italy. This mystery beckoned to me.

I started with the records we already had and started digging on [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org). I discovered that Bernardino had immigrated to Rio de Janeiro in 1912 from the village of Avanca in the Aveiro region of central Portugal. Luckily, FamilySearch had records of the Catholic Church in Avanca spanning hundreds of years.

I started scouring the records, page by page, and finding my ancestors, name by name. Each time a document provided a clue to advance a generation in my family tree, I felt a rush, like a drug. And I felt proud, too; all of my discoveries were backed up by hard evidence, not spurious family lore. 

I spent untold hours doing this and found hundreds of ancestors and relatives. This includes an unbroken patrilineal chain between me and Aleixo Simão, born c. 1590 in the neighbourhood of Paredes in Avanca, the same area his 8th great-grandson, Bernardino, would one day be born in and leave for Brazil.[^2]

## Staggered flights, again

When the time came for us to leave Chile, I thought it'd be a good idea if I were to return to the US earlier than Vero and Samuel. 

It would be the third time I left my wife behind in Chile because I was impatient.

At least my heart was in the right place this time. I wanted to go back to Orem by myself so I could stuff a small container with our belongings and then drive our family car with the rest of our stuff to Amherst, NY, where we had rented an apartment. When Vero and Samuel arrived in Amherst a week later, they'd find a fully furnished home with all utilities running. 

My goal was to make their transition as smooth as possible. I did not realize that, for Vero, the hardest part of the transition would be hopping from long flight to long flight by herself with a toddler in tow.

[^1]: I'm told more modern houses in Chile, particularly of the upper middle-class, do feature fibreglass insulation, although central heating is still rare.
[^2]: One day I'll write a detailed story of the Marques of Avanca so my descendants can have an additional resource to consult when they start getting curious about their origins like I did.
