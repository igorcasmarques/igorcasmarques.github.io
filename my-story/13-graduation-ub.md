*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) and [portfolio](/docs/portfolio/intro) in different areas of this site.* 

## Finally

A few months after Elias was born, [ELISION](https://elision.org.au/) came to UB. 

ELISION is an insane new music ensemble from Australia that I'd long worshipped. I couldn't believe that their tour stop in Buffalo should coincide with the presentation of my dissertation piece. Since UB was sponsoring ELISION's coming, I asked Felder whether I could have them play my dissertation.

"OK... but they're bringing a weird band," he said. "Weird even by their standards."

"Weird how?"

"I'll send you their email. It's an octet or nonet with things like drums, lap steel guitar, uillean pipes... if you write for them, your piece won't have much of a performance life. It'll be one-and-done." 

It's safer for composers to write for common instrumental groupings (and their subsets) because this increases the likelihood of the piece being picked up by various ensembles. 

But writing music was never about playing it safe for me. New music is already a weird field; if my dissertation piece was going to be played only once, I might as well make it so weird it'd be impossible to replicate.

I wrote a recited monodrama based on the poetry of [Ferreira Gullar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferreira_Gullar) for actor, stage props, an 8-piece chamber ensemble, and a stereo fixed-media track. I called it [*Noturno*](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2303837514?sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses), and premiered it alongside ELISION in April 2019. 

This collaboration with ELISION remains the highest honour of my career.[^1]

## Now what?

Shortly thereafter, I successfully defended my dissertation and was awarded my PhD. UB's commencement ceremony took place on Vero's 31st birthday, and my parents and an uncle and aunt from Utah flew in to be with us that day. 

After the ceremony, Vero took a picture of me in my PhD regalia holding our sons, one on each arm, in front of a beautiful cherry blossom on campus. Just like I wanted.

I was done. My 13-year-long post-secondary journey that had started in 2006 was finally over. 

But my satisfaction evaporated quickly; I didn't have a job lined up, and none of what I'd achieved in prior years mattered if I couldn't secure a job offer. 

### Whew!

Two weeks after my graduation, my [I-20](/my-story/9-from-orem-to-buffalo.md#about-visas) expired and our family entered the grace period of my immigration status. I had to land a job in three months or leave the US.[^2]

Then, well into the summer of 2019, a miracle. UB needed to replace a music theory professor who was retiring, and they offered me the gig. I don't know why they waited that long to find a replacement, but their procrastination played to my advantage. I had already taught music theory there for years, I got along with the other theory instructor in the department, and they needed someone ASAP.

UB offered me a one-year contract to start in the fall and assigned me the role of full-time Clinical Assistant Professor in the Music Department. 

What a relief! Our family was back on track. I sent all the required paperwork to the [US Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/) (USCIS), and waited for my employment authorization document (EAD) to arrive.

I tried not to worry too much about 2020. I'd continue to do my best and things would work out like they had hitherto done. 

### Move

Unlike what I earned as a teaching assistant, my new job would pay me a living wage, so Vero and I decided to move out of our apartment and rent a house with a yard. After years of barely scraping by, we felt we were moving up and our family deserved a better home.

In hindsight, moving was not a good idea. Our rent doubled, the house was infested with mice, and I didn't know that what we did to or in our yard would matter to anyone but ourselves. In fact, when our tenancy was over, our landlady chose to keep our deposit and ghost us mainly because I let thistles grow on a thin strip of soil between our driveway and the neighbour's fence.[^3] 

## Now what??

But the worst consequence of moving was missing the delivery of my EAD, which had been sent to our old apartment.

### Stop

At the time, I didn't think this was a big deal.

*USCIS says I'm legally entitled to work. All the paperwork has been cleared. I'm just missing the actual card, which should be arriving at my correct address soon because I set up a forwarding address with the United States Postal Service.*

I shared my mailing snag with the Human Resources person in the Music Department, and assured them that there was enough time for my EAD to bounce between USCIS's return address in Missouri and my new address in Amherst before classes started. 

"In the meantime," I added, "here's a print-out from the USCIS website that states that I'm authorized to work. Just in case."

Unfortunately, the EAD did *not* arrive before classes started, but the HR rep seemed satisfied with the print-out, and I started working. A few days into the semester, however, they sought me, frantically, while I was teaching a class.

"You have to stop *right now* and go home," they said. "I've just been told that you absolutely cannot work until you bring me your physical EAD. No other document will do."

"Doesn't the print-out I gave you already have all the information you need?," I asked. "It has my USCIS number and the EAD's duration. That should be enough for you to check that I'm OK to work with [E-Verify](https://www.e-verify.gov/), no?"

"I don't know about that. What I *do* know is that I need your EAD. It's the law. There's no other way. We'll find a replacement for you while you wait for the card to arrive. But now you need to go."

The department was willing to wait for my EAD because they knew this debacle could've been avoided if they hadn't waited until the middle of the summer to offer me the job.

### Wait

Days started passing, and there was no update on the USCIS website about them re-sending my EAD. Why was it taking so long?!

I began to believe that there was a chance that I'd never get my EAD, or that I'd get it so late I'd lose my job. Then it'd be game over for my career and our family's future in the US.

Our family was also running out of money very quickly.

I couldn't just sit on my hands. Even though USCIS makes it virtually impossible to seek help from other human beings, I called their phone number every day and sat on the line for hours hoping to talk to someone to whom I could plead my case.

Sometimes I pressed 2 for Spanish in the USCIS phone line. Maybe there'd be less traffic. Maybe it'd be easier to tug at the heartstrings of my fellow Latin Americans.

I learned which Church wards were close to the USCIS office in Missouri, and got in touch with their bishops. Maybe there were members in those wards who worked for USCIS and could intercede for us.

I even pestered USCIS employees on their social media accounts after doing some online sleuthing. 

Nothing worked.

Nobody helped. 

I begged and grovelled and abased myself to no avail. It was harrowing. Vero and I were both losing it.

## Now what???

Then, a few weeks later, the EAD finally arrived. 

Just like that, unceremoniously. I took it to the HR rep, they photocopied it, and I was cleared to work again.

### UB reprise

The ordeal with my EAD had broken me, but the fall semester was in full swing at UB, so I shook off the trauma and moved on.

Teaching at UB was fun and fulfilling. I'd become an engaging educator after teaching there for four years, and I had great rapport with my students. I was in my element.

But I really came into my own in my second term there, when I was assigned to modernize [MUS 116](/my-story/9-from-orem-to-buffalo.md#ub-year-1) to try and reverse its dropping enrolment rate. I even published an [academic essay](https://ojs.library.osu.edu/index.php/engagingstudents/article/view/7694/6331) about this experience.

I wanted to build my career at UB. I had dreams of becoming a real researcher with a focus on video game music and accessibility in music theory pedagogy. I wanted to keep writing music and collaborating with the amazing musicians and ensembles that passed through Buffalo. 

More than anything, I wanted our family to put down roots in Amherst. Vero was happier than she'd ever been in Utah, and we both looked forward to raising our boys there.

### A faint hope

Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. New York state declared a hiring freeze, and I was told UB would not renew my contract or sponsor my H1-B.

I was let down, but not surprised. 

I figured this might happen, so I kept applying to jobs at other institutions during my time at UB. By that point, I must've applied to 120 jobs since the fall of 2018.

I only got one interview, at [Erie Community College](https://www.ecc.edu/) (ECC). It was an adjunct gig to teach a single course, but I wanted to get it because it'd tide us over till I found something more permanent. 

Whether ECC would be able to sponsor my H1-B became a non-issue when they got back to me a few days later to inform me that they'd chosen another candidate.

### End of the line

That was it. Time was up. We needed to pack our bags and leave the US.

But go where?

- Concepción, where Vero's family lived and where she could work as a dentist?; or, 
- Curitiba, where my parents owned a fully furnished apartment that we could live in rent-free while we regrouped?

The more Vero and I discussed our family's next steps, the clearer a third option became: why not Canada? 

[^1]: As Felder predicted, *Noturno* was never played again after its premiere.
[^2]: Vero and I never considered staying illegally in the country. It was impossible to work undocumented in New York state except in some questionable off-the-books arrangements like informal gigs or as a day labourer. We were also scared overstaying our visa would compromise our future chances to obtain a proper work permit.
[^3]: We took our landlady to court and won, but the ordeal was very unpleasant all the same.
