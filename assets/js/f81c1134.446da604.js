It was nice. Trance-like. They did four songs, which were all a little samey, but I liked it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext up were [Nirthal](https://www.facebook.com/Nirthal), also local and billed as \\"King Diamond worship.\\" I didn\'t care much for their stuff, but others in the audience enjoyed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimeval Well played last. They were **great**. They played selections from their second LP, [*Talkin\' in Tongues with Mountain Spirits*](https://primevalwell.bandcamp.com/album/talkin-in-tongues-with-mountain-spirits) (2021). My favourite tracks were \\"She Flies Undead\\" and \\"Where All Things are Forgotten.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\r\\n  <img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dopnll2lm/image/upload/v1771819212/capital-noise/copy_of_20260221_224014_yhjmqw_ce734e.jpg\\" style={{width: \'70%\'}} />\\r\\n  <figcaption style={{fontSize: \'0.8em\'}}>Primeval Well</figcaption>\\r\\n</figure>\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimeval Well\'s shtick is mixing black metal and bluegrass, which sounds like a really strange pairing, but they make it work. They engage with Appalachian folk spirituality so earnestly, it elevates their brand of atmospheric black metal. Full marks from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nA special mention about [Ryan Clackner](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/ryan-clackner-feature), the band\'s guitarist, vocalist, and main creative force. You get a pretty good idea how inventive and well developed his playing is from the albums, but seeing it live is something else. And a great singer to boot. What a beast."}]}}')}}]);
