You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## College or university? Both!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2005, at the age of 17, I took the entrance exams for [music production](https://sacod.ufpr.br/artes/musica-licenciatura-e-bacharelado/) at the [Federal University of Paran\xe1](https://ufpr.br/) (UFPR) and for [music composition and conducting](https://embap.curitiba1.unespar.edu.br/menu-ensino/graduacao/bacharelado-em-composicao-e-regencia) at the state\'s [College of Music and Fine Arts](https://embap.curitiba1.unespar.edu.br/) (Belas). I really only cared about the program at Belas, whose conservatory I\'d already been attending since I was 10, but my parents and my school teachers expected me to apply to UFPR because it was the most prestigious university in the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nI passed the exams with flying colours and enrolled in both programs simultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\n### UFPR\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the day, I attended UFPR. I felt impressed by my professors\' credentials, most of whom had earned their terminal degrees and made a name for themselves in the US and Europe. Still, lectures were three-hour-long information dumps and the practical labs were a little too crowded to be useful. I enjoyed parts of my time at UFPR, such as socializing with like-minded people, but exams were hard and I struggled academically.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Belas\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my day at UFPR ended, I bussed downtown to Belas, where college courses were held in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Video game music\\r\\n\\r\\nMy harmony instructor at Belas asked us students about our long-term goals. \\"I want to write music for video games,\\" I said. Everyone chuckled, thinking I was joking. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Oh, you\'re serious...,\\" the instructor realized. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was. I knew it was a viable career choice, even then. I wasn\'t offended by their laughing, though; my answer was unusual for the time and place and laughing was a fair reaction. Besides, I\'ve always enjoyed making people laugh, regardless of the reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Counterpoint\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother instructor, who taught counterpoint, had us listen to and analyze Victoria\'s [*O magnum mysterium*](https://youtu.be/9xPh-fXYAc4?si=BvWIHRapQ_IhjSPp). \\r\\n\\r\\nI had **never** heard anything like that. It moved me to tears. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would have similar experiences later in life with the final movement of Mozart\'s [\\"Jupiter\\" Symphony](https://youtu.be/UsNk-7j9lpY?si=Urm8cFJn8IGiyObl&t=1588), [*Mille regretz*](https://youtu.be/dkfVzCZ68_Q?si=WMq4gcyNpIRFHNVd) by Josquin des Prez, and some of Monteverdi\'s [madrigals](https://youtu.be/YUgIJ212IVg?si=A0skWk9NgEqHSxVX). Come to think of it, beautiful music has made me cry much more as an adult than sadness.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Nightly commutes\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter classes ended at about 22:30, I bussed back home with my best friend from church, who was a first-year student at Belas like me. Despite the late hour, buses were bustling with people who also had night classes in nearby colleges. It was a vibrant atmosphere, and my friend and I had some of the most fun conversations I\'ve ever had on those commutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nI felt fortunate to have a friend like him, with whom I could connect deeply on many levels. Our paths would diverge in later years, and I was never to regain a friendship like that in my adult life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lived seven blocks away from the bus stop, and I was often accosted by aggressive stray dogs on the way home that late at night. They must\'ve felt territorial because the streets were deserted and they were after females in heat. I soon learned that they\'d leave me alone if I threw rocks at them, so I always picked up some as soon as I got off the bus. \\r\\n\\r\\nI had to run a few times, but I was never bitten.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Provo-bound\\r\\n\\r\\nStudying in two different institutions was unsustainable. Thankfully, it didn\'t last long. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany of my older cousins were attending [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/) (BYU) at the time, and my parents thought I should too. At first, I resisted the idea, but they convinced me that going abroad would give me the best chance to succeed as a musician, and I acceded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was a student of UFPR and Belas, I also had to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Prepare for and take an English proficiency test.\\r\\n- Record myself playing some piano pieces for my portfolio.\\r\\n- Schedule the ecclesiastical interviews BYU required.\\r\\n- Fill the application form, which included writing essays about my background and goals. \\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t know that the school year in the Northern Hemisphere was different than ours in Brazil, so I completed my application months after the deadline had passed. I applied so late that BYU had already sent out decision notifications by the time they received my application package.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, somehow, I was admitted to start in the fall of that same year. My father maintains that this was only possible due to the intercession of an old family friend who knew someone in the admissions office. I think my father overestimates the pull this family friend had, but whatever the case, I got in.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Na\xefvet\xe9\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2006, I quit my studies in Curitiba and went to Provo with my mother. With the help of my cousins, I rented a shared room a few blocks away from campus and my mother helped me furnish whatever little space I had. A few days later, she went back home and my solo adult life began in earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat first year at BYU was very confusing. I didn\'t understand a whole lot about what was happening. For example, I didn\'t know that I had to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Enrol in courses by myself, taking care to avoid double-booking or conflicts with my work schedule.\\r\\n- Submit a separate application to the program that I wanted to join, music theory and composition. That threw me for a loop.\\r\\n- Plan how my courses would fulfill university-wide and program-specific requirements. I didn\'t have to worry about that in Brazil because our universities assigned all students the same course schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also didn\'t know any of the higher-ed lingo, e.g., undergraduate vs. graduate, and I didn\'t understand how these words related to my reality. What was the difference between teaching assistants (TAs), adjunct faculty, and full-time professors? I played it safe and just addressed everyone by the title of \\"Dr.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll I knew for certain was that my family expected me to get good marks, qualify for merit-based bursaries, find a part-time job, and leave on a mission for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/) the following year. That was the path my older cousins had blazed for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n### My first jobs\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November, I landed my first real job ever. I worked in the cafeteria of the [Provo Missionary Training Center](https://provo.mtc.byu.edu/). My duties were straightforward: clean the kitchen and serving areas and restock chafing dishes that were running low. Despite the simplicity, I was never trained how I thought I should\'ve been, and I often felt lost in the job. It certainly didn\'t help that I earned minimum wage and not a cent more.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months later, a cousin of mine who worked for [BYU Broadcasting](https://www.byutv.org/) got me an interview for a job as an English-Portuguese translator. Their boss offered me 25\xa2 above minimum wage, and I accepted without hesitation. My cousin became my supervisor and mentor for my four-month stint at that job and we often hung out together after work.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Money stress\\r\\n\\r\\nMy student visa allowed me to work 20 weekly hours, and I worked all 20 hours every week, but money was still always tight. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2007, the little cash my mother had left me ran out, and I realized that it was hard to make my money stretch all the way to the next paycheque. I started skipping breakfast and supper and set aside an $8-10 budget for a daily midday meal. Taco Bell and Little Ceasar\'s gave me the best bang for my buck, and that\'s what I mostly ate during that first year in university.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sundays, I went to my aunt\'s after church to enjoy my only decent, home-cooked meal all week. I also visited my cousins who lived nearby during the week to scavenge their leftovers. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith their permission, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of this frugal regimen, there were a few times when I ran out of money a day or two before payday. When this happened, I powered through the hunger and didn\'t eat until I had money again. I didn\'t want to keep begging for food from my cousins. (I would\'ve used credit cards if I knew what they were.[^1])\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the cousin who worked with me found out I hadn\'t eaten in a while during one of these forced fasting sessions, they went to the pizza joint they side-gigged at and brought me a whole Hawaiian pizza, free of charge. Hawaiian has been my favourite kind of pizza ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nI haven\'t talked to this cousin in over a decade. There seems to have been a dispute that caused some family members to sever ties with one another, but I wasn\'t in Utah when that happened. I don\'t know what was said, I don\'t know who was right or wrong, but I\'ll always remember this estranged cousin for his kindness toward me when I was a young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: I did have a Best Buy credit card at the time, but I didn\'t know how it worked. My cousin helped me get it so I could \\"build my credit.\\" I didn\'t know what that meant, and I only used the credit card once. I paid off the balance on the same day of the purchase and never used it again. To this day, I don\'t know if I could\'ve used the card for non-Best Buy purchases."},{"id":"mission-year-one","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/mission-year-one","source":"@site/my-story/2-mission-year-one.md","title":"2.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s a mission?\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring that first year at BYU, I got a call to serve as a full-time missionary for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/) in New Jersey. I was to leave in May 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church sends missionaries to places far from their homes and calls them to share the \\"[invite [people] to come unto Christ](https://www.comeuntochrist.org/).\\" In practice, this means missionaries spend most of their day-to-day finding people willing to listen to them so they can visit them in their homes, share a set of spiritual messages, and bring them to church on Sundays.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Introversion\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a missionary was uncomfortable to me. Knocking on random doors, stopping people on the street, feeling empathy for strangers, sharing my faith in the hopes that people would feel the way I did about it. None of these things came easy to me. A sense of religious obligation and the camaraderie of my fellow missionaries buoyed me up during those two years of near-constant rejection and derision.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, I wasn\'t a very successful missionary. I was obedient and hard-working, but had little to show for my efforts. I struggled to get people to attend church, and in two years, I only helped one person be baptized into the Church. They left a week later and never returned. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a missionary, I operated on the assumption that sharing my convictions was enough, but the truth is that effective missionaries leverage charisma and emotional appeal to get people to commit. Just like salespeople. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I\'m no salesperson.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Nomenclature\\r\\n\\r\\nMissionaries work in companionships (usually pairs, but also trios) and count their time on the mission field in terms of *transfers*, i.e., periods of six weeks. \\r\\n\\r\\nEach companionship is assigned to work in an area with fixed geographical boundaries (we had detailed maps for them). At the end of each transfer, the mission\'s top leaders decide whether a missionary should stay in the area they are currently serving in or move to a new area. On average, missionaries spend 3-4 transfers in one area, where they cycle through a couple of companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI served in seven areas.\\r\\n\\r\\n## First areas\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though I was called to serve in English, my mission leaders placed me in Riverside when I arrived on the field so I could work with the area\'s large Portuguese-speaking population.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Riverside\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t get along with my first companion. I felt sad and lonely that first transfer, especially at night. We lasted one transfer together. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy next companion was on his last transfer. It was summer, he was ready to go home, and we didn\'t accomplish much of consequence either.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suffered from sleep paralysis in Riverside. It happened twice. The first time was scary, but I realized what was happening and weathered it. The second time was much worse. I heard noises and saw figures. One of those figures was a pale man with a black beard and bloodshot eyes. He got close to me, face to face, and howled at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time later, I dreamed with Jesus Christ. He was much taller than me, and he hugged me warmly for a long time. I knew it was just a dream, but it made me feel better, and I haven\'t had sleep paralysis ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Burlington\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two transfers in Riverside, I was moved to nearby Burlington and placed in a trio with another Brazilian missionary. We were to keep working with the Portuguese-speaking people of the area. We worked hard and had a lot of fun, but we were not able to get a group of Brazilians to come to church consistently like we had been tasked to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Burlington, I discovered that missionaries have their own folklore. Some of it was harmless fun, like silly traditions and superstitions. For instance, some missionaries kissed their right-hand knuckles and fist-bumped the roofs of their cars whenever they crossed an intersection with a yellow light. If they did this and the light didn\'t turn red until after they\'d crossed the intersection, they\'d have good luck with the ladies after the mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other aspects of missionary folklore were more pernicious. My wife has advised me against writing in detail about the sensationalistic, baseless stories some missionaries and members liked to spread. Suffice it to say that one could tell a person\'s sexual anxieties by the rumours they perpetuated.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t participate in missionary folklore, harmless or otherwise. I thought it was all detrimental to the work we hoped to accomplish.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Switch to Spanish\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was in Burlington, my Mission President reached out to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"How\'s your Spanish, Elder Marques?,\\" he asked me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"It\'s OK, I guess. Spanish is similar enough to Portuguese that I can understand like 70%,\\" I replied. \\"I don\'t know how to speak it, though.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"That\'s probably good enough. I will be transferring you to Freehold, where you will be a senior companion and serve in Spanish. Good luck.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n### Freehold\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion in Freehold was eccentric. Maybe he was neurodivergent, maybe he had a personality disorder, maybe he was just odd\u2014hard to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, during our daily language study in the morning, he chose to study Russian instead of Spanish, even though we never interacted with anyone who spoke Russian. When we visited people, he\'d often refuse to speak, close his eyes, and go to sleep while I shared the messages. If it was narcolepsy, it was very capricious because it only happened in visits. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne time he even caught and ate a house centipede just to be funny.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, the more I learned Spanish and interacted with Latin American immigrants, the more I became enamoured with the language, the people, and their cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Brunswick\\r\\n\\r\\nCongregations in the Church are called \\"wards\\" or \\"branches,\\" depending on their size.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Freehold, Spanish-speaking members of the Church were few and had to attend the English-language ward. Visitors felt alienated by the language barrier, and were not motivated to return. In New Brunswick, NJ, my next area, there *was* a Spanish-speaking branch. This gave us the support we needed to do our best work.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Receptivity\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Brunswick was not a particularly big area, so every day we whipped out our creasy Rand McNally maps and rode our bikes everywhere. We got to know the city intimately well and I fell in love with it, warts and all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs missionaries, we observed that people in rougher neighbourhoods tended to be more receptive to us. While middle-class people generally ignored us or scorned us, working-class people were more likely to treat us decently, even when they weren\'t interested in what we had to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wondered why poorer people treated us better. I\'ve had cynics tell me it\'s because of ignorance, but I think that\'s a dehumanizing take. I saw a confluence of factors:\\r\\n\\r\\n- They appreciated the hope and stability our family-oriented messages promised them.\\r\\n- They\'d been primed by life\'s unfairness to be more open to alternative paths to happiness, whereas middle-class families were more determined to find happiness in normalcy and conformity.\\r\\n- They were more prone to hang out on the street and engage with people there\u2014including us. \\r\\n- They felt connected to their blocks, streets, and neighbourhoods, and saw us as part of this social landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Training\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a transfer in New Brunswick, my mission leaders assigned me to train a \\"greenie,\\" i.e., to be the first companion of a brand-new missionary. \\r\\n\\r\\nTraining is a big milestone for missionaries, and I took the task seriously. I got lucky and the new missionary, who was from Mexico but had been living in the US since the age of 5, was a great young man. He helped me become fluent in Spanish, and we became fast friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### River of blood\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion and I shared an apartment across Boyd Park on Route 18 with an English-speaking companionship. There was a friendly member of the English ward who lived a block away from us, so our flatmates visited him frequently. This member was notoriously generous, and gave the English-speaking missionaries a lot of food and clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, this member gave our flatmates kilograms upon kilograms of venison. They were not a hunter and we had no idea how they\'d gotten the venison, but the English missionaries didn\'t want to look a gift horse in the mouth and brought the meat back to our apartment. We fit what little we could in the freezer and left the rest sitting on the kitchen counter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, we went to bed. We were unsupervised 19- and 20-year-olds and did not see a single problem in our plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, I woke up to one of the missionaries yelling, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"What in the world?! Guys, wake up! Come here! There\'s a river of blood!\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nHe\'d gone to the kitchen half-asleep in the morning and saw that the meat sitting on the counter had thawed and that **A LOT** of myoglobin had seeped through the packaging and pooled on the floor. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a pain to clean and the kitchen reeked for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Hospital visit\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people resented us when we knocked on their doors unannounced or stopped them on the street. We only did it because we felt it was important; nobody likes inconveniencing others and being rejected dozens of times a day. It\'s not like we were getting paid or anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, we were constantly looking for better ways to find people willing to have us over. One day, we decided to start calling members of our branch who hadn\'t been to church in a long time. Maybe they were ready to start attending church again and had family members or friends who\'d be interested in hearing our messages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found out that a lady from our branch was in hospital, awaiting an important surgery. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Is it OK if we pay you a visit to give you a blessing?,\\" we asked her over the phone. She agreed, and we visited her that same day. Her boyfriend barely tolerated our presence in the hospital room, but he warmed up to us as we continued to visit their family after she was discharged. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe last I heard was that, soon after I left New Brunswick, they got married, he got baptized, and they were a happy family.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### V-days\\r\\n\\r\\nBack then, missionaries could only communicate with people outside of their areas by snail mail (with very few exceptions). In New Brunswick, I received an unexpected letter from a childhood friend, who\'d moved away from Curitiba nearly a decade before. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer name was Ver\xf3nica, but everyone called her Vero. Vero\'s letters were tender and entertaining, and I did my best to reply in kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she sent me her picture, I was struck. She was drop-dead gorgeous.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was developing feelings for her, but we were told to \\"lock our hearts\\" as missionaries so we could focus on the work. That was hard to do, what with our teenage hormones going off. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo I made a decision. I would only read and reply to Vero\'s letters on Wednesdays, which was our mission\'s day off. Wednesdays were called *preparation days*, or \\"P-days\\" for short, but everybody knew that they were my special **V-days**."},{"id":"mission-year-two","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/mission-year-two","source":"@site/my-story/3-mission-year-two.md","title":"3.

We\'d meet undocumented men who worked as day labourers and lived in cramped rooms with no beds or furniture of any kind in Asbury Park. We\'d meet children with rotten teeth and tattered clothing practically raising themselves on the street because it was better than being home with their parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we\'d drive down Ocean Ave and gawk at the mansions in Deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne time, my companion and I were caught in an unexpected thunderstorm while we were out on the street. We stopped under an eave to wait out the storm. A few moments later, one of the most random things that I saw on my mission happened:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. A minivan parked on the street.\\r\\n1. A man got off the minivan.\\r\\n1. He hurried to a house nearby and entered it.\\r\\n1. He came out of the house with an umbrella.\\r\\n1. He handed us the umbrella.\\r\\n1. He got back in the minivan and drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Atlantic City\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent my second winter in the mission in Pleasantville, near Atlantic City. Come December, we said yes to everyone who invited us for supper on Christmas eve. We went from home to home to home on a sort of holiday binge and ate a ridiculous amount of food on December 24, 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\n### The branch\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\'t have an actual church building in Atlantic City. Spanish-speaking members in the area attended a branch that rented a space in the city. This branch held two sacrament meetings each Sunday, one in the morning and one in the evening. No other congregation in the Church does this, as far as I\'m aware. Ostensibly, they did this to accommodate the members\' schedules, who had competing work shifts at the casinos in Atlantic City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt didn\'t really work out, though. Most people came in the morning. The attendance for the evening services was abysmal, and the few people who came consistently in the evening just took turns giving talks and saying the prayers. It was a little sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Atlantic City Spanish branch no longer exists. It was moribund when I was there during the 2008 recession, and I imagine that the closure of several casinos in the mid 2010s must\'ve driven off many of the Spanish-speaking immigrants in the area, whom the casinos employed as cooks, housekeepers, busboys, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Confrontation\\r\\n\\r\\nAs missionaries, we were used to belligerent people, and knew how to handle them. We were not shy about defending our beliefs when someone was hostile to us, but we tried to avoid confrontation as much as possible because it wasn\'t productive: religious discussions animated by anger are tugs of war with no winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe aspired to live by this verse in the Book of Mormon,\\r\\n\\r\\n> He that hath the spirit of contention is not of [God], but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we sensed that people just wanted to argue with us, we tried to retreat diplomatically. If they weren\'t ready to engage us in good faith on that occasion, at least we hoped they\'d remember us as decent people. But some people trapped us before attacking us (verbally, mostly).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever my companion and I were tired of working in Atlantic City, we took the train to Egg Harbor City and worked there. One of those days, a man didn\'t send us away after knocking on his door and talked to us on the doorstep. That was rare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Elder... Mar-KAY? Mar-KEE? What is that, French?,\\" he asked me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Portuguese. You can call me Mar-KES. I\'m Brazilian.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Brazilian? You\'re white. Blue eyes. Where\'re your folks from?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI got that all the time. People didn\'t realize Brazil was a diverse country. But this man wasn\'t ignorant; I could tell he was baiting me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"They\'re also Brazilian,\\" I replied. \\"In fact, my ancestors have been in Brazil since the 1700s. And before that, Portugal. Pretty standard for Brazilians.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Not at all. You\'re pure white. Not a hint of black or brown. You come from a lineage of untainted slave owners and Indian killers, don\'t you? Hundreds of years in Brazil and not one of your ancestors wanted to sleep with a black lady?\\"[^2]\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t know how to respond. The man was right, at least partially. I do have slave-owning ancestors. But that\'s just one branch of my family tree. There was also family lore about a great-great-grandmother who was a freedwoman from the early 1800s in Minas Gerais and another one who belonged to an indigenous group in southern Maranh\xe3o.[^3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I could think of a rebuttal, he invited us in, and we sat with him in his living room. We never refused an invitation to enter a home. He continued to be edgy and toy with us just to see how we would react. He was bored on a Saturday afternoon, and we were his entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I used to be gay, you know. I know how you guys feel about gays,\\" he said. The Church had been on the news recently for sponsoring ads in support of [Proposition 8](https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/lgbtq/prop8), which banned same-sex marriage in California that year. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"But I grew out of that,\\" he continued. \\"As soon as I tried ladies, I realized I really, really liked them.\\" He then described how he had met his wife, who was upstairs, in graphic detail. \\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t feel threatened by that man, but I did feel icky after the visit. Fortunately, shortly after leaving that man\'s house, we met a nice Honduran family, who invited us to make [baleadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleada) with them. They were modest and kind and sharing a meal with them restored my spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Princeton\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Atlantic City, my mission leaders sent me to Princeton, an English-speaking area, to finish my mission. It was springtime, and the streets in Princeton were fragrant, abuzz with bumblebees, and dressed in bright colours. It was unreal.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Companionship troubles\\r\\n\\r\\nFlowers aside, my time in Princeton was weird. On the one hand, I was at my boldest as a missionary. The apathy of the university community toward us somehow energized me, and I started to feel empowered by rejection. I walked upright and didn\'t have a problem talking to anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, I hardly connected with anybody. My first companion there was terrible. He refused to talk to people and chewed me out openly in front of anyone. He\'d been seeing a therapist, but the pressures of missionary work got to him and he ended up going home a few weeks later, six months before his release date.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe missionary that replaced him was lazy and petty, but not as mean. We worked less than we should\'ve and had zero success.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Technically, I taught at Princeton\\r\\n\\r\\nWith one exception.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman in her twenties was receptive to our messages. She was uncommonly bright and genuine, and was pursuing a graduate degree at Princeton. She\'d become good friends with a classmate who was a member of our ward, but I don\'t think she had ulterior motives vis-\xe0-vis her friend when she met with us; I think she was truly interested in what we had to say. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion and I shared our messages with this young woman and her member friend once a week in a classroom on campus. She eventually lost interest, and I still blame myself for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Not trunky\\r\\n\\r\\nRegrets aside, I was never trunky[^4] in Princeton and continued to work hard until my last day on the field.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: [3 Nephi 11:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p29#p29).\\r\\n[^2]: The way he spoke was ... much more **colourful** than how I feel comfortable writing.\\r\\n[^3]: Years later, I took a DNA test and confirmed that I have indeed African and Indigenous Brazilian ancestors.\\r\\n[^4]: Missionaries say they are *trunky* when they feel indolent toward the end of their missions, i.e., their trunks are packed and they are fixated about going home."},{"id":"long-distance-relationship","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/long-distance-relationship","source":"@site/my-story/4-long-distance-relationship.md","title":"4.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## In-person V-days\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I was honourably released from my mission in May 2009, I met with [Elder Richard Scott](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/leader/richard-g-scott?lang=eng), a member of the [Quorum of Twelve Apostles](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/quorum-of-the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng). Among other things, he told me that my next priority should be finding an \\"eternal companion.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nMy mind went to Vero.\\r\\n\\r\\n### First kiss\\r\\n\\r\\nVero had broken up with her previous boyfriend some time before I came back home and agreed to go to Curitiba to be with me in the four months I had between finishing my mission and resuming my studies at BYU. We wanted to see if we were as compatible in person as we were in writing, and if it\'d be worth committing to a long-distance relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were. Vero and I clicked instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had fun getting to know each other and going to Curitiba\'s tourist destinations. She smelled good and I liked the way she spoke Spanish. I even serenaded her with a song I\'d written on the piano. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were in line at a fast food joint, I hugged Vero from behind, she turned her face around, and we kissed for the first time. I still get butterflies in my stomach thinking about that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Pololeo\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Vero and I had spent some time together in Curitiba, I realized I\'d fallen in love with her. I wanted to tell her how I felt but I was embarrassed to do it, so every now and again I\'d spell out words on the palm of her hand with my index finger, Helen Keller-style, to express my feelings. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, we found ourselves in the back of my parents\' car on a long road trip. I took her hand and asked her, \\"Will you be my girlfriend?,\\" using my tactile writing system. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe said no; she wanted me to ask her out loud and in a more appropriate setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days later, we went to a nice Mexican restaurant and I asked her to be my girlfriend again, this time out loud, and she said yes. We agreed the connection we felt was worth nurturing in a long-distance relationship while we were both in university, and I promised to do my best to visit her in Chile at least once a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n### First time in Chile\\r\\n\\r\\nMy parents loved Vero and were supportive of our committed relationship. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Vero left Curitiba and went back home, my father told me he\'d cover the cost of an airfare to Concepci\xf3n, Vero\'s hometown, so I could see her again before going to Provo. I went, met Vero\'s family and friends, and fell more in love with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Classical 89\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I finally made it to Provo a few months later, I landed a job interview at [Classical 89 (KBYU-FM)](https://www.classical89.org/), the university\'s classical music radio station. It was the perfect fit for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Interview\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interview was a bit more intense than I expected. At one point, one of the interviewers asked me if I was able to tell who the conductor and orchestra were just by listening to a recording. \\r\\n\\r\\nNo way. Not even nowadays. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe said he could. It was not a weird power move, though; he was a nice guy and hoped to bond with me by nerding out together. Overall, the interviewers wanted to make sure that:\\r\\n\\r\\n- I was passionate about classical music.\\r\\n- I could write \\"my way out of a paper bag.\\"\\r\\n- I had a good voice for radio.\\r\\n\\r\\nI checked the first two out of these three boxes; my accent and lack of experience got in the way of the third. Nevertheless, they saw my potential and offered me the job.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Job duties\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people who hired me at Classical 89 gave me the title of *assistant producer* and told me that that was not the position that I had applied for\u2014that had gone to another young man\u2014but that they\'d liked me and wanted to keep me because another student was going to graduate soon anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy main tasks as an assistant producer were: \\r\\n\\r\\n- Assisting with the logistics of concert recordings\\r\\n- Editing and packaging interviews and live performances for the air\\r\\n- Supporting the full-time announcers in their shifts\\r\\n- Pre-recording shifts that would air on weekday evenings and weekends\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'d always chosen my words carefully because I hated being misunderstood as a child, and working at Classical 89 helped me elevate that personality trait into communicative power. I learned a lot by reading what I\'d written aloud and then revising it until it sounded good enough to say it on the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Crisis of self-awareness\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, I checked out a portable Zoom recorder at work. Strangely, I noticed that the recorder\'s storage was almost full, even though people used to format the recorders after using them and before checking them back in. \\r\\n\\r\\nI listened to the recording to find out who\'d made it so I could ask for their permission to clear the recorder\'s memory and use the recorder for my project. \\r\\n\\r\\nI heard the voice of the young man who\'d gotten the position I\'d applied for. I\'d been working with him for several months and I thought he was a nice guy. He was interviewing his wife in the recording, apparently as a joke to test the equipment. It piqued my curiosity, so I listened on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, he began to role-play as me in the recording. He put on a thick accent and started acting stupid. In his role-play, he, or rather, *I* was courting his wife like a jackass while she laughed and refused my advances. \\r\\n\\r\\nI thought it was weird that she acted like she knew who I was, even though we\'d never exchanged more than a couple of words. Was I the person that couple liked gossiping about? Were there other people who thought I was like that, a creepy idiot?\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped the recording and deleted the file. I was so perplexed that I couldn\'t keep listening. Maybe that parody of me was a truer version of myself than the person I thought I was. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow rare and fleeting self-awareness can be. The person I think I am, the person others perceive me to be, and the person I really am, may as well be three different people.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Chile 2010\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 2009, one of Vero\'s friends moved from Concepci\xf3n to Provo. I\'d met her in Chile and thought she was great fun, so we got together once or twice after her move to Provo. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday, 27 February 2010, she called me in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 27F\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Have you had any news from Vero?\\" Her voice wavered with a hint of desperation. \\"I can\'t get in touch with my family!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Why? What\'s wrong?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"You haven\'t heard?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Heard what?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"There\'s been a [massive earthquake near Conce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Chile_earthquake), one of the worst ones ever! And a tsunami, too. Phone lines are down, internet\'s down, nothing\'s working, so nobody knows if people there are OK.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe commiserated with each other and tried calling, emailing, using social media, anything to reach the people we loved down there. Over the course of that weekend, she was able to talk to her family, and I got a call from Vero, who apparently had borrowed a satellite phone. \\r\\n\\r\\nVero told me that the earthquake had been vicious, but that her family was OK and their home appeared to have suffered no structural damage. Life was complicated with severe aftershocks, looting, damaged roads, and a lack of services, and they were traumatized and constantly on edge but safe. Vero told me not to worry, then hung up.[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\nChileans are proud of their resilience and the country gradually resumed activities in the following weeks, even though many people continued to struggle for years with the after-effects of 27F.\\r\\n\\r\\n### World Cup\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo months after the earthquake, I travelled to Chile. I was impressed by the ruins of the [Alto R\xedo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edificio_Alto_R%C3%ADo), a 15-storey building near the Biob\xedo river that broke in half and collapsed during the earthquake. An [imposing but controversial memorial](https://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/atanacio-soza-arquitectos-memorial-27f-a-potential-symbol-of-drastic-change) was erected near the site of the Alto R\xedo in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also noticed that 27F had become a scapegoat for problems that clearly antedated it, so I started joking with Vero and blaming 27F for any minor inconvenience I had.\\r\\n\\r\\n2010 was a World Cup year as well, and Chileans were excited about the prospects of their national team. The Chilean squad did very well in the tournament until they had to go against Brazil in the round of 16, at which point they were properly thrashed, 3-0. That could\'ve caused some friction with my girlfriend, but she was as Brazilian as she was Chilean, and felt comfortable with whatever outcome of that match. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Year 3 at BYU\\r\\n\\r\\nFall 2010 marked the beginning of my third year in university. Academically, I was doing very well and had qualified for two simultaneous full-tuition scholarships.\\r\\n\\r\\n### ALMA\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever I wasn\'t in class or at work, one could find me in the [Advanced Lab for Music Applications](https://music.byu.edu/facilities/electronic-facilities) (ALMA) in BYU\'s Harris Fine Arts Center (HFAC). Located in a weird annex of the HFAC away from heavy foot traffic and furnished with row after row of MIDI keyboards and audio workstations, the ALMA became a sort of sanctuary for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nI thought back to my reticence about applying to BYU, and the ALMA made me feel grateful for my parents\' insistence.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Move to Orem\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2010, my parents decided to spend a small fortune they had been saving to buy a condo in Orem near exit 273 of the I-15. It had high ceilings, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a nice balcony with a view of the [Wasatch Mountains](https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/parks-outdoors/wasatch-mountains). It was a couple of blocks away from [WinCo](https://www.wincofoods.com/), my favourite grocery store ever, and about 5 km away from scenic [Utah Lake](https://utahlake.gov/).\\r\\n\\r\\nThat condo would be my home until 2015. I loved living there and never took it for granted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs 2011 rolled around, life was going well. I continued to excel in university, I loved my job and my condo, and I had all the support I needed to feel stable and happy. I talked to Vero every night, which was no replacement for us being *physically* together, but was enough to carry me over until next summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, I began to sense a new spectre nearby: my quarter-life crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Vero has fascinating stories about 27F, but they are hers to tell."},{"id":"marriage","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/marriage","source":"@site/my-story/5-marriage.md","title":"5.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## Fear of failure\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned 23 in 2011 but didn\'t feel like an adult. In my mind, I was still the wide-eyed teenager from Curitiba. I didn\'t have a clear artistic voice, my portfolio was unremarkable, and my creative output was mutating from \\"impressive for my age\\" to \\"not sure how this will help me get a job\\" and \\"maybe I should\'ve become a diplomat like my dad wanted.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, my older cousins were finishing their undergraduate degrees and getting jobs, showing me what professional success looked like for international students like us. Their steps became my roadmap: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Attend university with an [F-1 student visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment).\\r\\n1. Secure a job to activate F-1\'s \\"optional practical training\\" (OPT), a post-graduation temporary work permit.\\r\\n1. Have the employer sponsor the transition from F-1 to an [H-1B work visa](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b) after the OPT.\\r\\n1. Live out the required number of years on H-1B to qualify for permanent residence, i.e., the [Green Card](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card).[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousins were also getting married and having babies by then. None of them considered going back to Brazil a viable option. They all wanted to make a life for their families in the US\u2014as did I. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I set a couple of goals to help me accomplish it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Goal 1: Terminal degree\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the (living) composers I knew and admired had gone to grad school. No (living) composer I knew was making enough money to raise a family by writing music right out of undergrad. Ergo, I needed to get a master\'s and a doctorate in music composition if I were to get any good at it, and if I got good at it, I\'d land a permanent, well-paying, visa-sponsoring job.[^2] \\r\\n\\r\\n... right?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'d take me much longer than my cousins to get to the coveted H-1B step, but eventually I\'d get there, and then it would all have been worth the extra effort. I would\'ve had my cake and eaten it too.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Goal 2: Family\\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I had always had a serious, marriage-oriented relationship. In 2010, we talked about our future and chose to get engaged. We spurned the custom that appeared to prevail in the US that a man should propose to a woman on one knee, seemingly out of the blue, with an expensive diamond ring and a specific short-term wedding date.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Brazil, engagement is an agreement, not a surprise ultimatum one springs on the other, and then both people wear plain gold bands to show they\'re engaged\u2014somewhat dear, but still a fraction of the price of the diamond rings people go into debt for in the US. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion that culminates in the decision to get married can happen in a specially romantic or significant place for the couple, but usually there are no theatrics involved. Engaged couples then invite their family and friends to a party to announce and celebrate their engagement, and remain engaged for up to a few years until the conditions are right to get married.[^3]\\r\\n\\r\\n## Concepci\xf3n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I visited Vero in Chile in 2010, we got our wedding bands\u2014courtesy of my maternal grandmother\u2014and announced our engagement to our families and friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe thought it\'d be a good idea to get married in December 2011. Vero would be done with university coursework and would need an just additional half year to complete her residency. Incidentally, as an international student in the US, I could defer my studies for a half year, making me able to move to Chile and support her during her residency.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Wedding\\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I got married in the church of the [University ward](https://maps.churchofjesuschrist.org/wards/130354) in Concepci\xf3n. The ceremony itself took place in the chapel and was officiated by one of the city\'s justices of the peace (JP). Vero had stressed to me how important it was to be punctual because Chilean JPs were notoriously impatient with delays, but she acted against her own advice and arrived half an hour late to our wedding. I was freaking out, but luckily our JP didn\'t seem to mind Vero\'s tardiness. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we were married, the JP left and Vero and I went to the nearby campus of the [University of Concepci\xf3n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Concepci%C3%B3n), her alma mater, to take pictures with a photographer. Meanwhile, our guests started on the appetizers in the church\'s cultural hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur wedding reception was modest but plentiful and fun. Dozens of relatives and friends attended\u2014including my parents, siblings, and an aunt who worked tirelessly that day to decorate the hall we held our reception in. We ate a delicious meal prepared by the catering business Vero worked for on weekends and danced until late that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the reception, Vero and I travelled 500 km north to Santiago, where we were [sealed in the temple](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/what-happens-in-a-temple-sealing?lang=eng) the following day. This ordinance extended our civil marriage beyond death, and deepened our commitment to each other. Then we flew to Uruguay and spent our honeymoon in Punta del Este.\\r\\n\\r\\n### First apartment\\r\\n\\r\\nA week later, Vero and I were back in Concepci\xf3n. We lived in a tiny one-bedroom apartment on Ongolmo, close to Paicav\xed and Carrera, a central area in the city with lots of young people like us. Nights were rough for me because our neighbours were loud and drunk people often argued and fought in front of our apartment building. Vero slept through it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the seasons changed, we experienced some of the most terrifying windstorms I\'ve ever seen. One time, I was walking back from church alone on a Sunday afternoon when I heard a heart-stopping noise. A powerful gust had lifted a large corrugated zinc sheet from a building behind me and sent it dancing in the air, thundering with each flutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother time, there was such an intense driving rain that water was spouting violently out of the rabbets of our apartment\'s windows. The putty on those windows was old and spotty, so I had an idea: stuff the rabbets with thin plastic bags, like the ones grocery stores used to give customers back then. Vero laughed and laughed, but it worked. It didn\'t look great, but it worked. \\r\\n\\r\\nI still brag about the presence of mind I showed that day, and Vero still laughs. But I\'ve never minded her laughing. I love to make her laugh more than anybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Censo 2012\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long, Vero settled in her routine at her residency while I looked for a job. Money continued to be a pressing issue because we didn\'t have savings and Vero\'s residency didn\'t pay. I\'d also been taught, for better or worse, that a man\'s worth depends on his work ethic and his ability to financially support his family. Since I was not studying, I had to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first job in Concepci\xf3n was at a radio station, selling ad space. I hated it and quit after my first paycheque.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, I learned about a relatively well-paid, temporary gig for the government that aligned perfectly with our time frame. Chile was going to hold its [decennial census in 2012](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censo_chileno_de_2012), and they were looking for an army of census takers. I applied and mysteriously got the job, even though no one else we knew who had applied\u2014and there were many in our age group\u2014had been selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nI **loved** working for the census. It was all of the fun parts of my mission minus the rejection and heartache. I walked the streets of Concepci\xf3n 10 hours a day, going from home to home and interviewing people about their lives and families. I met people across the socioeconomic spectrum, from well-to-do traditional families to squatters and drifters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a census taker could be hilarious, too. Many people did not understand the questions we asked\u2014or what the census itself even was. This led to some confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### \\"Material\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to ask people what their residences were made of. Most people had no idea. Some people answered \\"material,\\" which is as vague and obvious in Spanish as it is in English. They said it with such confidence, too. \\r\\n\\r\\nI soon learned that some old-timers used \\"material\\" in opposition to wood, so it basically meant brick and mortar (for houses) or reinforced concrete (for apartment buildings).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Being indigenous\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen people declared they were Indigenous, the mandatory follow-up question was about the ethnic group they belonged to. For registered Indigenous people, the answer was straightforward. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose who self-identified as Indigenous but weren\'t registered didn\'t have strong ties with a particular group, so they were generally stumped. Some of them then walked back and said they weren\'t actually Indigenous, while others doubled down and said that all Chileans should consider themselves Indigenous. These people picked the [Mapuche](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mapuche) as their ethnic group because to them the Mapuche represented anti-colonial resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Polyglots\\r\\n\\r\\nThe census asked people about the languages they spoke. It was not uncommon for upper middle-class parents to proudly state that their children spoke two, three, four languages. It was not just parental pride; it was a matter of social prestige and a return of their investment. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chile, private K-12 schools are the norm for middle-class families. This includes lower middle-class families, who prioritize private education for their children as soon as they can afford it. Some private schools for the upper social classes in Concepci\xf3n distinguished themselves from the rest by offering foreign-language immersion programs and calling themselves the \\"British\\" or the \\"French\\" or the \\"Arabic\\" school. This fed into the strong pro-foreigner (especially pro-European) bias I\'ve found Chileans to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'d spoken with Chileans in English and had good reason to doubt those kids spoke all of those languages fluently, but I put down whatever their parents told me.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Aud\xedfono\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word for \\"hearing aid\\" in Spanish is *aud\xedfono*, which is the same word for \\"headphones.\\" One of the questions I had to ask was, \\r\\n\\r\\n*Do you have difficulty hearing, even with a* hearing aid *on?* \\r\\n\\r\\nSome young people who didn\'t know what a hearing aid was thought I was asking them, \\r\\n\\r\\n*Do you have difficulty hearing when you have* headphones *on?* \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Well, yes,\\" one young man told me. \\"I like to listen to loud music on my iPod and can\'t hear anything when I\'ve got my headphones on.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI wasn\'t supposed to question people\'s answers and had to record exactly what they said, but  whenever this misunderstanding happened, I\'d clarify what type of *aud\xedfono* I was referring to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Oh, OK, then no.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Relation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe census required us to determine how people were related to the head of household. The question we had to ask about each person was something like,\\r\\n\\r\\n*Cu\xe1l es su relaci\xf3n con el jefe de hogar?*\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich means,\\r\\n\\r\\n*How is this person and the head of household related?*\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible answers included: self, spouse, child, parent, etc. However, because *relaci\xf3n* can mean \\"relationship\\" in addition to \\"relation\\" (as in degree of kinship), what some people heard was,\\r\\n\\r\\n*What is this person\'s relationship with the head of household like?*\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they\'d start going off about their marital problems or parenting challenges, which people somehow thought the census would like to record. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Can I go now?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the census ended,[^4] I felt empty. I could only watch so much *The Office* (US) and play so much *Batman: Arkham City* on my PlayStation 3 before I felt a strong urge to resume \\"my life\\" in Orem, as selfish as that was. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Some of my cousins were able to speedrun this process by marrying US citizens. \\r\\n[^2]: I knew that composers-slash-producers who worked for mass media didn\'t need a terminal degree, but I didn\'t want to go into that. Even though I had gotten into music composition because I wanted to write [music for video games](/my-story/1-from-curitiba-to-provo.md#video-game-music), my time at BYU convinced me that a career in academia would give me the most freedom to pursue my crazy ideas.\\r\\n[^3]: Getting engaged in Chile was similar enough.\\r\\n[^4]: The 2012 census in Chile was [controversial and likely fraudulent](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censo_chileno_de_2012#Controversias), and had to be re-taken five years later. I have zero regrets about how I performed my duties, but apparently there were systemic issues with the whole process."},{"id":"graduation-byu","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/graduation-byu","source":"@site/my-story/6-graduation-byu.md","title":"6.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## Back in Orem\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to my university courses, I had a lot to do in the fall of 2012:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Polish my portfolio and resume\\r\\n- Take the [Graduate Records Examination](https://www.ets.org/gre/test-takers.html)\\r\\n- Apply to graduate programs in several universities\\r\\n- Write my capstone project\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I should\'ve stayed a little longer in Concepci\xf3n. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Vero\'s graduation\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned to the US in late July 2012 to prepare for my classes and to get everything in order for Vero to come after her convocation ceremony in mid-September. \\r\\n\\r\\nI regret doing it that way. I could\'ve arranged an accommodation to miss the first few weeks of classes at BYU to attend Vero\'s graduation. Even in the worst case scenario, I could\'ve survived a few bad marks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was my first big lapse of judgment as a husband. Being a good and loving husband has been a learning process for me. I\'ve never been abusive or mean, but I wasn\'t very affectionate at that stage, and I didn\'t prioritize my wife like I should have.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Salary negotiation\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after I went back to work at [Classical 89](https://www.classical89.org/), a cousin of mine helped me land a job offer at the [MTC](https://provo.mtc.byu.edu/) to be a Portuguese-language tutor. I loved working at Classical 89 and didn\'t want to leave, but I also could not refuse work that paid 35% more than what I earned at the time. Especially now that there were two mouths to feed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to see my boss at the radio station to hand in my notice. I was transparent with him and he asked me, \\"If we match what they\'ll pay you at the MTC, will you stay?\\" Part of me hoped for this outcome, but I honestly didn\'t think I\'d be able to use my MTC job offer as leverage to negotiate a significant raise; I thought the station simply could not afford to pay me any more than they did. When my boss suggested the raise, I felt relieved and grateful, and I happily stayed at Classical 89 until my graduation.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Vero\'s ESL classes\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Vero arrived in the US, her English was good but not yet fluent, so she enrolled in BYU\'s [English Language Center](https://elc.byu.edu/) (ELC) and studied English full-time from January-April 2013. During this period, her immigration status changed from F-2 (spouse of an international student) to F-1 (international student), which meant she could now obtain a Social Security Number and a driver\'s licence, and work part-time on campus like me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn theory, ELC students could work any job on campus. In practice, the vast majority of them worked custodian jobs that required little to no communication skills, and that\'s what Vero did as well. She cleaned office spaces in the Wilkinson Center from 4-8 a.m. on weekdays before attending classes. It was a far cry from being a dental surgeon in Chile, but we could use the money and Vero was a good sport about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of what I did at Classical 89 by that point was pre-recorded, so I arranged with my supervisor to work a very early shift like Vero. My voice sounded nice and deep at that time of day, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaking up that early was hard, though. Both of us had attended [early-morning seminary](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/si/seminary?lang=eng) every day at 6 a.m. as teenagers, but our condo was located more than 15 km northwest of campus and we had to wake up at about 3:15 a.m. to shower, get ready for the day, and get to work on time. S\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing made our commutes easier. As we drove down Canyon Rd and then 900 E in Provo and got closer and closer to the Wasatch Mountains, we often saw groups of white-tailed deer grazing on people\'s lawns and even on the campus greens. It was magical. They never dared coming down from the mountains after sunrise. \\r\\n\\r\\nI kept hoping we\'d run into a cougar, which is BYU\'s mascot, either on our commutes or when we explored the trails in Rock Canyon, but we never did.\\r\\n\\r\\n## One quarter century down\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I turned 25 in the spring of 2013, I\'d been married for a year and a half and had been accepted to the master\'s program in [music composition at the University of Utah](https://music.utah.edu/students/programs-degrees.php#comp) (U of U). They offered me a full-tuition scholarship and a graduate assistantship that paid more I had ever earned\u2014a low bar to clear, but nice anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\nI went on to graduate *cum laude* from BYU, and felt that I had become a seasoned radio producer after working at Classical 89 for nearly four years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI no longer saw myself as a kid. I was an adult. Life was going according to plan, and I grew confident. I still felt underdeveloped as a composer, but I was hopeful I\'d achieve the artistic maturity I sought in grad school.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, Vero and I agreed: it was time for a baby.\\r\\n\\r\\n### First pregnancy\\r\\n\\r\\nVero became pregnant with our first son, Samuel, when we were in Concepci\xf3n, right before my master\'s started. I returned to the US before her to \\"prepare everything\\"\u2014the excuse I used to leave Chile and selfishly resume \\"my life,\\" again\u2014while she had a stopover in Curitiba. We knew she\'d been pregnant for about six weeks, so my mother took her for an ultrasound in Curitiba, and they heard Samuel\'s heartbeat for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not have health insurance in the US, so we signed up for prenatal care at a community health centre in Provo that offered sliding fee discounts for low-income people like us. The care Vero received at this clinic was not excellent and ultimately led to complications that caused Samuel to have a difficult premature birth.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Year 1 at the U of U\\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I chose not to move when the U of U accepted my application. We continued to live in the Orem condo my parents owned so we could save rent money. Our family was growing, after all. We also saved on gas because the U gave me a public transit pass, and that\'s what I used to travel the 65 km each way to go to campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course schedule of my master\'s was more spread out over the week than in my undergrad and my responsibilities as a grad assistant were flexible, so I didn\'t have to go to campus every day. When I did, Vero drove me to the Orem train station so I could take the [FrontRunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrontRunner) north to Murray Central, where I switched to the campus-bound [Red Line TRAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAX_(light_rail)#Lines_and_stations). It took me nearly two hours to go from home to campus or vice-versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rarely drove myself to campus. It was twice as fast as public transit, but it left Vero stranded at home and was less comfortable and productive than riding the trains for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FrontRunner had desks with eletrical outlets, and I could usually find one to sit at and play *Civilization V*, compose, or do some homework. When I switched to the TRAX\u2014which were more like buses\u2014I liked reading books on my Kindle and listening to Ricky Gervais\'s [podcasts and old Xfm episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais#Radio) with Stephen Merchant and Karl Pilkington. I got hooked on their brand of humour and consumed everything else I discovered by them, like the animated HBO show, *An Idiot Abroad*, and *Derek* on Netflix.\\r\\n\\r\\n### \\"Painful to read\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI got along well with my composition instructor at the U of U, [Morris Rosenzweig](https://morrisrosenzweig.com/bio). He was incredibly talented and clear-minded, and had the personality of a lovable grouchy old man, always kvetching about this or that. He held me in high regard, higher than I deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to understand what made him tick. I interviewed him about his creative process and his daily routine, and wrote a paper about him, which I then submitted to [*Perspectives of New Music*](https://www.perspectivesofnewmusic.org/). \\r\\n\\r\\nI had to become a published researcher if I were to succeed in academia, and at almost 26 years of age, I needed to do it sooner rather than later. It was intimidating to submit a paper to *Perspectives* because it was (and still is) the go-to academic journal in the field of contemporary music in the US. But I\'d gotten an A in the paper in my research methods course, so I figure I had a chance. How bad could it be?\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty bad, actually. I got a scathing response from *Perspectives*. One reviewer wrote, and I paraphrase, \\"I hope it was less painful for Rosenzweig to sit through the interviews with this writer than it was for me to read this horrible paper.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI still have the email from *Perspectives* but I can\'t bring myself to open the attachment with the reviewers\' comments, even after all these years. It was the lowest blow to my self-esteem to date. It\'s not like I didn\'t know rejection, either; rejection had been my daily bread as a missionary and a constant companion in my undergrad when I applied to competitions, new music festivals, and grad school programs. But this email from *Perspectives* was particularly scarring.[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\n## Water breaking\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night in the winter of 2014, Vero started having frequent and powerful contractions. She was scared, but I assured her that they were [Braxton Hicks contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braxton_Hicks_contractions), and told her to go back to sleep. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, her water broke. She was officially in labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a nightmare. The baby had been suffering from intrauterine growth restriction and, at 35 weeks of pregnancy, he was not ready to be born. It was happening too soon. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe went down the three flights of stairs from our condo in quick spurts between Vero\'s contractions, got in our natural gas Honda Civic, and zoomed as fast as we could to the Utah Valley Hospital in Provo. It was the longest and loudest 15-minute car ride of my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: It\'s hard to write this and not feel a deep insecurity bubbling up from that trauma. I hope the love of the people I\'ve written this for, my family and friends, will help them see past my shortcomings."},{"id":"samuel","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/samuel","source":"@site/my-story/7-samuel.md","title":"7.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## Samuel\'s birth\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we made it to hospital, a security guard rushed Vero in a wheelchair to her delivery room while I parked the car. I made my way up to Vero\'s room soon thereafter and saw hospital staffers hooking her up to medical equipment and asking all sorts of questions. They told us that Vero was well dilated and too far along the labour process to have an epidural, and that she was going to deliver the baby without anesthetics.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Hard delivery\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin minutes, the intervals between Vero\'s contractions reached a critical frequency and nurses and doctors swarmed around her and told her to push. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt didn\'t take long. After a few pushes, Samuel was born, but there was no crying. He was lifeless like a rag doll and his skin was purple-ish. A doctor moved him to a corner of the delivery room while I kept repeating to myself, \\"Something\'s wrong, something\'s wrong, something\'s wrong.\\" My hands were shaking and I began to rock my body and cry. This must have lasted no more than a minute. I was about to collapse when the doctor who had been tending to Samuel managed to resuscitate him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they took him away. What happened?\\r\\n\\r\\nI was relieved that Samuel had survived his traumatic birth, but I could not shake the thought that he may have endured permanent neurological damage. I started freaking out again when a nurse handed me a drink. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey told me it was just orange juice. I think they might have spiked it with some benzodiazepine but could not disclose it. They must have been used to dealing with weak dads like me. Whatever the liquid was, I calmed down instantly after drinking it and asked Vero if she\'d be OK with me going to check on Samuel in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\\r\\n\\r\\n### NICU stay\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor put Samuel in an incubator, inserted an intravenous drip on a vein on his head, and connected him to respiratory support. I was overwhelmed with love and concern for him. He was tiny, even for preemies, and looked hurt and emaciated. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor told me that Samuel was stable and was going to keep getting better every day. I spent some more time there next to the incubator, then went back to Vero\'s room to report and rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Growth  \\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel spent almost three weeks in the NICU. The hospital wanted to keep him there until he grew enough to fit safely and comfortably in a baby car seat. The doctor got Samuel off the ventilator a day after he was born, but the nurses kept tracking his oxygen level during his entire stay; I can still hear the machine beeping each time it dropped below 90% before going back to normal a few moments later.\\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I were so worried about his weight that we meticulously measured how many millilitres of milk she pumped each time, how many millilitres he drank, and how many grams he grew each time the nurses weighed him. We noticed that his growth was slow and irregular, but at least he was growing.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Waiting\\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel\'s first week in the NICU coincided with spring break at the U of U, so I was able to be with him and Vero without interruptions. When classes and work resumed for me, my mother-in-law arrived in the US and filled in for me in the NICU, though I still visited the hospital whenever I could. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Samuel slept, I kept Vero company and read books. On Sunday evenings, I liked to watch Neil deGrasse Tyson\'s *Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey* in the hospital\'s breakroom, which premiered that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had to go home after visiting hours, Vero would spend her nights looking at pictures and videos we had taken of Samuel in her cellphone. The nurses had told her that doing that would help with her milk production and her emotional well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Finally home\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 18 days in the NICU, the hospital staff asked us to put Samuel in his car seat and leave him there for a while. They observed him and concluded that he was ready to go home. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the beginning of spring, and we dressed Samuel with a cute teddy bear outfit when we first brought him home. I drove very, very slowly on our way back from hospital. When we arrived in our condo, we were all tired but relieved and thankful.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Sleeping issues\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Samuel outgrew his bassinet and switched to a crib, he became fussy about sleeping. He had to be rocked for 10-30 minutes in the dark to the sound of white noise to fall asleep. Then, I\'d look at his eyelids to figure out when he had entered rapid eye movement sleep; that was the sign that he could be transferred to his crib.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I had to do it **very** carefully. Any sudden move, noise, or light, and Samuel would jolt awake, forcing me to repeat the whole process again. I learned to do a whole choreography that involved slowly sliding my arms from under his body and then waiting next to his crib for a few minutes to make sure he would not wake up when I tiptoed backward to the door of his room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as nights were concerned, Vero and I had a plan. When Samuel woke up: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. I picked him up and brought him to Vero, who stayed in bed.\\r\\n1. Vero breastfed him and changed his diaper.\\r\\n1. I put him back to sleep in his crib.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it was a good division of labour, but it was brutal on both of us. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Mental health issues\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter my mother-in-law and my mother went back to their respectives homes, our sleep deprivation intensified the effects of Vero\'s hormonal changes and her sense of isolation and triggered a post-partum depression that went undiagnosed and untreated. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt trapped, abandoned, left behind. She watched her colleagues in Chile advance in their careers while she lost all hope in hers. She often cried, complained, and lashed out at me, despite my best efforts to ease her burden: I helped with Samuel; I did chores; I took our family on outings. But nothing seemed to have more than a temporary effect on her disposition. I was not able to make her laugh like before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer suffering got to me, and I began to break, too. No difficulty I had ever experienced before could compare to the agony I felt then. I\'ve never fully recovered from that time, and I suspect that neither has Vero.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Love above all\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of our hardships, I fell in love with Samuel more and more each day. \\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t know I was capable of loving so deeply and intensely. He imbued my life with purpose and adjusted my priorities. My studies, my career, my ego, nothing else seemed to matter too much in comparison to my son\'s (and my wife\'s) welfare and happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Back to the U of U\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the fall of 2014, Vero\'s diligent breastfeeding and mothering had helped Samuel become a healthy, happy, and plump baby boy with no apparent sequelae of his complicated birth. He was still small, but Samuel\'s pediatrician told us that this was not a problem per se. After all, I\'m a short man myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was afraid Vero would have a hard time when I went back to school, but a visit from her older sister and two close friends from Chiguayante in October propped her spirit. After they were gone, we had Thanksgiving and Christmas with my cousins and their families to look forward to. Fun things would happen again; we just had to be patient. \\r\\n\\r\\nI continued to work hard on my master\'s degree. I taught university courses in music theory, sight singing, and dictation to 1st- and 2nd-year music majors at the U of U. I wrote my thesis project and helped coordinate the logistics of two new music ensembles. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also applied to 10 different doctoral programs, all outside of Utah. I thought that my family needed a change of scenery in 2015."},{"id":"graduation-u-of-u","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/graduation-u-of-u","source":"@site/my-story/8-graduation-u-of-u.md","title":"8.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## Time for a PhD\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly three of the 10 doctoral programs I applied to advanced me to the next round in the application process: the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/academics/music/composition-ma-phd/) (UCLA); the [Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/music/curriculum-and-degree-information/composition-concentration) (CUNY); and the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/programs/music-composition-phd.html) (UB).\\r\\n\\r\\n### UCLA\\r\\n\\r\\nUCLA had me travel to Los Angeles to \\"audition\\" for them. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter taking a test on music theory and history, I sat down for an interview with the graduate admissions committee of the School of Music. They grilled me on aural skills and some more theory. At one point, after I said I liked [Webern\'s Symphony](https://youtu.be/Xq2gwuKDPnY?si=kG_G3iJ8Z9c_eA09), a senior member of the committee asked me if I had memorized P0, an arbitrary series of twelve notes in the Symphony\'s first movement, and whether I could explain its permutations in the exposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn\'t. He could. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been teaching a graduate seminar about it for years and years. I hadn\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the end of the interview, a young faculty member wanted to discuss one of the pieces in my portfolio, an orchestral work titled *Purple Robe*. I wrote it for the [BYU Philharmonic](https://pam.byu.edu/ensembles/philharmonic-orchestra/) two years prior, while I was still an undergraduate student. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Purple Robe* starts out as a thicket of uncoordinated and repetitive noise that gradually gives way to a baroque vocalise. It\'s very expressive. The part I like the best is the transition between the last bit of noise and the vocalise, which features straight-up clapping by the orchestra\'s percussionists. It\'s ridiculously simple but it gives me goosebumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t impress the UCLA committee enough to get a spot in the program and they wait-listed me, which was just as well because they hadn\'t exactly passed my vibe check either. I found the people there to be as stuffy as the weather, and LA traffic was purgatorial.\\r\\n\\r\\n### CUNY\\r\\n\\r\\nI was excited for my interview at CUNY. I liked the idea of living in New York City and studying with [Jason Eckardt](https://www.jasoneckardt.com/), a composer I looked up to a lot. \\r\\n\\r\\nCUNY\'s committee interviewed me over Skype. They were unaffected and patient and put me much more at ease than the UCLA people did. I thought New Yorkers were supposed to be curt and short-tempered and Angelinos were laid-back, not the other way around.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put my foot in my mouth a few times in the CUNY interview. I made a political joke that totally bombed. When they asked me about my interests, i.e., my *research* interests, I said I liked archaeomusicology (which I knew nothing about) and \\"walks on the beach.\\" Yikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCUNY also wait-listed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n### UB\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween my interviews at UCLA and CUNY, I got a phone call from composer [David Felder](http://www.david-felder.com/). During his 30-year tenure at UB, Felder had amassed an impressive catalogue of prize-winning original works and prestigious commissions and collaborations. He was also the founder and director of the [Center for 21st Century Music](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/music21c.html), which brought new music superstars from all over the world to Buffalo throughout the year and especially in the summer during the [June in Buffalo](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/music21c/june-in-buffalo.html) conference. Felder\'s professional network was second to none. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no admissions committee at UB. Felder called the shots. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe and I were on the phone for half an hour, and like [Rosenzweig](https://morrisrosenzweig.com/bio) at the U, he believed in me much more than I did. He told me about how often I\'d be able to work with first-rate composers and ensembles, name-dropped a few illustrious alumni of the program, and then he sweetened the deal by saying that I would get a [Presidential Scholarship](https://www.buffalo.edu/honors/funding-aid/prospective-students.html) on top of my full-tuition waiver and my teaching assistantship.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was sold. I thanked UCLA and CUNY for considering my application and asked them to remove me from their wait lists.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s \\"new music\\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nTime for an aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy bachelor\'s, my master\'s, my PhD, all of it was to become a composer of *new music*. But what I (and many others) call new music is not just any music that is new; new music refers to the work of living composers who see themselves as continuators of a 1,000-year-old Western European tradition that reveres the *score*, music\'s written medium. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe score is the means for composers to crystallize intricate and goal-oriented systems of relationships between musical events, and for students to learn from them. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople tend to call this type of music \\"Classical,\\" so it makes sense that some call the music living composers write \\"contemporary Classical.\\" Other terms include \\"art music,\\" \\"concert music,\\" \\"modern music,\\" just \\"contemporary music\\" (without the \\"Classical\\"), etc. Each term is more problematic than the next, and composers and listeners have been arguing about this issue since forever. \\r\\n\\r\\nMe, I prefer *music*, no qualifiers, but if I have to specify, I go with *new music* because it\'s the broadest and because it emphasizes innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nClose parentheses.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Chile between degrees\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I finished my master\'s in the spring of 2015, our family flew down to Chile to be with Vero\'s family in Chiguayante until we had to move to Buffalo in the fall. Vero\'s parents lived in a house west of Manuel Rodr\xedguez, Chiguayante\'s main thoroughfare, between a Unimarc grocery store and the town\'s train tracks. It also had a nice view of the Manquim\xe1vida hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Routine\\r\\n\\r\\nVero\'s mood improved by being in familiar places with her loved ones, and we settled into a routine. Samuel woke up very early, between 5-6 a.m., and had breakfast with my mother-in-law while Vero and I slept in. When we woke up, we took over his care, watching *Thomas the Tank Engine* on his tablet and playing with his toy trains until *almuerzo*, our main meal at midday. \\r\\n\\r\\nI still love *Thomas* and I get a lump in my throat when I watch clips of the old episodes with Ringo Starr and George Carlin because they send me back to that trip and all the one-on-one time I shared with my son.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Wintertime\\r\\n\\r\\nI also took Samuel out for walks around the neighbourhood whenever he was bored or fussy, which ended up happening once or twice a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sometimes crossed paths with nosy ladies who were horrified that I\'d be out and about with a toddler in the middle of winter. To them (and to most people I met in southern Chile), winter was something to hide from and endlessly whine about. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think they act this way because winters in southern Chile are on a liminal zone between not cold enough for snow, which would be aesthetic, and not mild enough to be easily ignored\u2014temperatures in Concepci\xf3n hover between 5\xb0C and 15\xb0C. This in-betweenness and people\'s lack of resources have created a building culture that has largely eschewed proper insulation and central heating in favour of space heaters powered by liquefied gas or kerosene.[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd blankets. Lots and lots of blankets.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut step away from the 3-m radius around the heater, and the rest of the house feels like the inside of a refrigerator, cold and damp. In fact, sometimes it feels colder inside a house than outside\u2014which is one of the reasons Samuel and I went on walks!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Family history\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Samuel ate his *almuerzo*, I put him down for a nap. With luck, he\'d sleep for a couple of hours, which which gave me time to engage in my favourite pastime in my twenties: researching my family history. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\'d wanted to know who my ancestors were from a very young age. I think it\'s a tantalizing hobby for people like me who feel they\'re too different from their parents because we hope to find the key to understanding why we are the way we are hidden deep in our ancestry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s hard to explain, but I\'ve always felt a powerful call.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### \\"It\'s all done\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of my my blue eyes, I used to fantasize that my ancestors were Viking warriors or Celtic druids. Never mind that my father used to say that we were Portuguese because my mother had already done all the work and traced our origins all the way until the paper trail died in the 1300s.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother descends from the Arantes of Braga, a minor noble family with deep, deep roots in northern Portugal\u2014obviously not Vikings, but maybe descendants of Celts after all. Thanks to the work of distant cousins before us, we know that the Arantes arrived in Brazil during the gold rush of the 1700s, and that they were influential landowners and key players in the local politics of southern Minas Gerais in the 18th and 19th centuries. They also owned slaves, by the way, as [that man in Egg Harbor City](/my-story/3-mission-year-two.md#confrontation) had guessed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was just one branch of my family tree. There was so much more that we did not know.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Avanca\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, we knew nothing of my father\'s paternal grandparents other than their names and likely origins: Bernardino from Portugal and Anna from Italy. This mystery beckoned to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started with the scattered records we already had and started digging on [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org). I discovered that Bernardino had immigrated to Rio de Janeiro in 1912 from the village of Avanca in the Aveiro region of central Portugal. Luckily, FamilySearch had records of the Catholic Church in Avanca spanning hundreds of years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started scouring the records, page by page, and finding my ancestors, name by name. Each time a document provided a clue to advance a generation in my family tree, I felt a drug-like rush. And I felt proud, too; all of my discoveries were backed up by hard evidence, not spurious family lore. \\r\\n\\r\\nI spent untold hours doing this and found hundreds of ancestors and relatives. This includes an unbroken patrilineal chain between me and Aleixo Sim\xe3o, born c. 1590 in the neighbourhood of Paredes in Avanca, the same area where his 8th great-grandson, Bernardino, would one day be born in and leave for Brazil.[^2]\\r\\n\\r\\n## Staggered flights, again\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came for us to leave Chile, I thought it\'d be a good idea if I were to return to the US earlier than Vero and Samuel. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be the third time I left my wife behind in Chile because I was impatient.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least my heart was in the right place this time. I wanted to go back to Orem by myself so I could stuff a small container with our belongings and then drive our family car with the rest of our things to Amherst, NY, where we had rented an apartment. When Vero and Samuel arrived in Amherst a week later, they\'d find a fully furnished home with all utilities running. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy goal was to make their transition as smooth as possible. I did not realize that, for Vero, the hardest part of the transition would be hopping from flight to flight by herself with a toddler in tow.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: I\'m told more modern houses in Chile, particularly of the upper middle-class, do feature fibreglass insulation, although central heating is still rare.\\r\\n[^2]: One day I\'ll write a detailed story of the Marques of Avanca so my descendants can have an additional resource to consult when they start getting curious about their origins like I did."},{"id":"from-orem-to-amherst","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/from-orem-to-amherst","source":"@site/my-story/9-from-orem-to-buffalo.md","title":"9.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## The Orem-Amherst move\\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived in Utah in late July 2015, while Vero and Samuel stayed behind in Chiguayante. My brother and a cousin of ours helped me put my family\'s stuff in a small container for a moving company to haul across the country for us, and I began the 3,100-km journey to Amherst on our beloved hatchback, a 2011 Nissan Versa.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Childhood experiences\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople romanticize road trips. Not me.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up, my parents took my siblings and me on many long road trips, especially to visit my grandparents who lived in Rio de Janeiro and Goi\xe2nia, 10 and 12 hours away from Curitiba, respectively. If I tried to read a book or do crossword puzzles, I got carsick. If I rested my head against the window, my parents scolded me. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"It\'s too dangerous,\\" they said. \\"In the event of a car crash, you\'d die instantly.\\"[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic helped with the boredom whenever decent radio stations were available. Sometimes we also played silly games to pass the time, like finding vehicles of a certain colour, but these games got old pretty quick. And then there was nothing to do but sit upright, wait until I got tired enough to sleep, then hope that by the time I woke up we would have arrived at our destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy parents and my sister reminisce about these road trips with fondness. They\'re some of their most treasured memories. I guess our perception is different.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Road trip rating scale\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an adult, travelling with Vero helped me get over my hang-ups about road trips. I still try to avoid them, but when they\'re unavoidable\u2014Vero insists on going to new places\u2014I\'ve figured out how I can make them bearable and, dare I say, even fun. \\r\\n\\r\\nGood road trips are characterized by six factors:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Dependable roads\\r\\n- Beautiful and/or varied scenery\\r\\n- Comfortable stops that divide the trip into manageable chunks\\r\\n- Enjoyable company\\r\\n- Exciting destination\\r\\n- Onboard entertainment\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being the longest road trip of my life by far, my journey from Orem, UT to Amherst, NY scored 6/6 in my rating scale. \\r\\n\\r\\n| Factor        | Orem-Amherst Road Trip |\\r\\n|:--------------|:-----------|\\r\\n| Roads         | I-80 and I-90 are well-maintained interstate highways and easy to drive on. |\\r\\n| Scenery       | Aside from some stretches of flat nothingness, e.g., Nebraska, I enjoyed seeing the changing vegetation and topography along the way and going through different urban centres. |\\r\\n| Stops         | I took short breaks in nice roadside service areas after every 4-5 hours of driving. I also spaced out the trip across three days, spending two nights in hotels. |\\r\\n| Company       | Vero is irreplaceable but I am quite content with my own company as well. |\\r\\n| Destination   | I couldn\'t be more excited about doing my PhD with a great adviser. I also felt that Vero and Samuel suffered from suburban ennui in Orem, and would thrive in Buffalo. |\\r\\n| Entertainment | I had [NPR](https://www.npr.org/), audio books, stand-up specials, music that I\'d been meaning to listen to for a long time, etc. |\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cross-country road trip was a sort of rite of passage that marked the end of my young adulthood. When I arrived in Amherst, I thought of my father, who had done so many business trips by car in Brazil that there was not a single obscure town people mentioned to him that he had not driven by. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I felt like I belonged in his league. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Vero\'s arrival\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days later, Vero and Samuel flew from Concepci\xf3n to Buffalo, with stops in Santiago and New York. When I picked them up at the airport, they were uncomfortable and sleep-deprived and their clothes were soiled with vomit.[^2] I regretted not having been there to support them. I thanked Vero, gave her and Samuel long hugs, and brought them to our new home in the hamlet of Snyder.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur new home was a small apartment on the second floor of a 1950s fourplex. The apartment had two bedrooms and one bathroom and we did our laundry in the basement with card-operated machines we shared with the residents of the other three apartments. Our apartment wasn\'t much, but it was sufficient for our needs and it was located on a neighbourhood with lots of trees and parks adjacent some 5 km from campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent the next four years in that apartment, and shared some of the happiest times we\'ve ever had as a family there.\\r\\n\\r\\n## UB (Year 1)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy classes started around Labour Day. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was assigned to have composition lessons with [Jeffrey Stadelman](http://www.jeffreystadelman.com/), I couldn\'t help but feel slighted by Felder, who had seemed so eager to have me as his student when we talked before. \\r\\n\\r\\nI did my best to take it in stride and Stadelman turned out to be a good teacher. He was calm and pensive, an interesting contrast with his towering height of over 200 cm. We met weekly until the spring of 2016, at which point he retired. I believe I was his last composition student at UB.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat first semester at UB, I taught a course on Brazilian music that I created from scratch. Unfortunately, it failed to attract many enrollees, so the following term the Music Department put me in charge of a section of MUS 116, an introductory course of music theory for non-musicians with consistently high enrolment rates. \\r\\n\\r\\nI grew to love MUS 116, and taught it seven more times until I left UB in 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Immigration issues\\r\\n\\r\\nA week after my classes started at UB, I noticed that my US visa was about to expire. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was terrified of overstaying my visa because I thought it would jeopardize my studies. I couldn\'t find any information about renewing my visa online, so I figured I had to talk to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) directly. Lucky for me, Buffalo is a major city on an international border, so there were four CBP offices I could go to and ask for help in person. \\r\\n\\r\\n### ~First time in Canada~\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, I put the address of the Peace Bridge CBP office on Google Maps and started driving. When I got to the bridge, I crossed it. I just crossed it. I kept thinking the CBP office was just a little further, just a little further ... until I made it past the point of no return, past the \\"Welcome to Canada\\" sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat in the line to enter Canada for a long time, wondering what I should tell the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer to get out of that messy situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Hello, bonjour\\" is how all CBSA officers greet people. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Uh ... yes, sorry, I entered Canada by mistake,\\" I said, rather pathetically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Pardon?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Yeah, I was looking for the American customs office when I took a wrong turn, and now I\'m here. I mean, this must happen all the time, right? People crossing by mistake, I mean.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Not really. Do you have a passport?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI did, but Brazilian nationals couldn\'t enter Canada without a visa. And I did not have a Canadian visa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Well, I\'m sorry, bud, but we\'re gonna have to deny you entry to Canada and send you back to the US.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Yes, I understand.\\" I felt really stupid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBSA officer instructed me to go to the Canadian border crossing office, where, after waiting for almost an hour, I explained the whole situation to a second officer, who was just as puzzled as the first one. Then I got a big red stamp on my passport, crossed the Peace Bridge back, explained my dumb mistake for the third time, and drove back home, defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n### About visas\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that week, I was able to talk to a CBP agent on the phone, and I realized I was even dumber than I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Visas are entry documents,\\" he explained. \\"Their only purpose is to grant you access to the country. This is why you couldn\'t find anything online about renewing your visa here in America. Because you can only renew visas in foreign countries.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Once inside the country, what determines how long you can stay in the country is your immigration status, which for  F-1 students like you, appears on your I-20 form. Do you see the date on your I-20?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Yes, it says it\'s valid until June 2019,\\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Well then, you have nothing to worry about for now,\\" he assured me. \\"As long as the date on the I-20 is valid, your visa can expire and there\'s nothing illegal about it. Your I-20 is what really matters.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"If you really want to renew your F-1 visa, though, you first have to leave America. Like, you can just go to Canada and do it in an American consulate there.\\" I just needed to make sure I got a Canadian visa first.\\r\\n\\r\\n### ~Second time in Canada~\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother-in-law wanted to visit us in the fall of 2015. She could use a break from her routine in Chile and Vero could use the help, so she bought a ticket from Santiago to Toronto\u2014it was more cost-effective than coming to Buffalo and still within a reasonable driving distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nI had learned my lesson. I wanted to pick her up at Toronto Pearson so I applied to a visa to Canada.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI figured that since I was driving in and out of Canada in the span of a few hours, I only needed a \\"transit\\" visa. I wasn\'t going to *stay* in the country, I wasn\'t even going to *visit* the country, I was just *transiting* through the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy visa request was denied. Why? Because \\"transit\\" visas are for passengers in connecting flights, and the right visa for me should have been just the good old \\"tourist\\" visa. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor someone who had lived abroad for nine years, I sure knew very little about immigration processes. Thankfully, Chilean nationals did not need a visa to enter Canada, so Vero ended up picking up her mother at the airport.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Holidays in Orem\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went back to Utah to attend my brother\'s wedding in Logan and spend Christmas at my sister\'s, who had recently moved with her husband into a spacious townhouse in Orem. My parents were there as well and we all had a great time together.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, a cousin of mine and his wife came to my sister\'s place. My brother-in-law had a PlayStation 3 in the basement hooked up to all of the gear we needed to play *Guitar Hero* with a group of people, so we went down there. Since I was going to sing, I chose the song: [\\"Mr. Crowley\\" by Ozzy Osbourne](https://youtu.be/o0RE230PlX4?si=vOtEUUpGEtn4mI-M).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Mr. Crowley\\" has a long synthesizer intro, so I improvised a spoken introduction on the microphone. I\'d heard the song so many times as a teenager that I knew the intro by heart, so I rambled on and on about darkness and occultism, and ended with something like \\"Please welcome to the stage: SATAN!\\" right before Ozzy sang, \\"Miiiiister Crooow-leeeey.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy timing and delivery were so on point that my sister, my brother-in-law, my cousin and his wife Vero all burst laughing. They were guffawing so much that we couldn\'t even play the game anymore. To this day, they tell me it was one of the funniest moments of their lives, which automatically makes it one of the proudest moments of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: I know my parents meant well and wanted to keep me safe, so I don\'t resent them. I must say, though, that I was surprised when I learned that no one I\'ve met seemed to know about this unbreakable rule that my family had. \\r\\n[^2]: Samuel\'s, just in case."},{"id":"first-real-successes","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/first-real-successes","source":"@site/my-story/10-first-real-successes.md","title":"10.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## Being a young composer\\r\\n\\r\\nOur family returned to Amherst in January 2016. There was a severe snowstorm when we arrived at the airport but our cab driver seemed unfazed by the whiteout and the low fuel warning light on his dashboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat winter, Vero and I had the chance to go to New York City to attend the premiere of *Su\xedte curitibana*, a solo bass clarinet piece that I\'d written at the end of my master\'s. It was the first time a piece of mine had been programmed in a concert outside of a university context, i.e., the first time someone played a piece of mine because they wanted to.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed at [Glen Nelson](https://www.centerforlatterdaysaintarts.org/about-main)\'s apartment in Lincoln Square. Glen is a writer and a champion of artists who are members of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng) and just an extraordinary human being\u2014worldly, urbane, generous. He and his wife came with us to the premiere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clarinetist did a great job, but *Su\xedte curitibana* didn\'t live up to my imagination. Still, I was happy. My music was finally being appreciated by people other than my teachers and classmates.  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Ideal collaborations\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circumstances that led to the premiere of *Su\xedte curitibana* were quite organic: \\r\\n\\r\\n- A new music ensemble came to UB.\\r\\n- They workshopped pieces by grad students, including one of mine.\\r\\n- The ensemble\'s clarinetist and I were simpatico.\\r\\n- He told me about his personal project of premiering as many solo clarinet pieces by living composers as possible.\\r\\n- I told him I had a piece for solo bass clarinet that hadn\'t been premiered yet.\\r\\n- He offered to premiere my piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how composers like to collaborate with performers: when there\'s goodwill and both stand to gain something. It\'s even better when performers are involved at the beginning of the creative process to accompany and guide the composer.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dilemma\\r\\n\\r\\nFor young composers in university, win-win collaborations with performers are hard to come by. University can tether us. Coursework eats up our time and directs our focus to pursuing marks rather than exploring our creativity and forming meaningful professional partnerships. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo try and catch up, we work extra hard after hours, but even then, our work will most likely still fall short of what other very talented, well-connected, avidly self-promoting young composers are doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why young composers can be straight-A students and still fail creatively and professionally. New music is an unforgiving field. It requires 100% dedication without offering any promises of success. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### *Why don\'t young composers stop worrying about marks?*\\r\\n\\r\\n- Good marks are necessary for bursaries, grad school applications, etc.   \\r\\n- In general, composers are inquisitive and like learning all of the other things a typical university education requires.   \\r\\n- Nobody enjoys performing below their capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### *Can\'t they just quit school then?*\\r\\n\\r\\n- Composition is just as hard as engineering, psychology, or any other university program, so most people can\'t learn it without teachers and curricula and all the structure universities provide.\\r\\n- The main patron of new music in the 21st century is academia and grant-giving institutions that favour academics. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### *So they need to be consummate professionals before finishing school?*\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrect. The quality of a composer\'s portfolio is what unlocks opportunities. But young composers can\'t populate their portfolio with good pieces if they don\'t have access to opportunities that yield such pieces in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### *How do young composers overcome this chicken-and-egg situation?*\\r\\n\\r\\nMost don\'t. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey endure it while they can, then pivot their careers to composition-adjacent jobs, such as teaching piano lessons or setting up PA systems, or to corporate fields their transferrable skills might be marketable to.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The spreadsheet \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hopelessness of the situation had been apparent to me for years, but it was only halfway through my master\'s that I noticed the common denominator of successful young composers: their resumes were peppered with distinctions associated with new music events and competitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy teachers didn\'t talk much, if at all, about these events. When I brought them up, some were even derisive, calling them \\"beauty pageants.\\" Yet they all proudly listed their prizes and prestigious collaborations in the program notes of their concerts. How did they expect me to get a respectable commission from, say, the [Fromm Foundation](https://frommfoundation.fas.harvard.edu/), if all I had was a barely passable portfolio?\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to be proactive and apply, apply, apply. Festivals, conferences, competitions, calls for scores, residences. If I threw enough stuff at the wall, something was bound to stick, and when it did, things would snowball from there. God\'s accountant was keeping track of my hard work and would make sure I got my due eventually.\\r\\n\\r\\nHopefully. \\r\\n\\r\\nThus, between 2014-2019, I consulted resources like the [Composer\'s Site](http://composerssite.com/), where opportunities for young composers to develop professionally are publicized. Each time I found an opportunity that I thought I\'d be a good candidate for, I plugged it into an Excel spreadsheet.[^1] \\r\\n\\r\\n### First two years\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, I entered 99 events in the spreadsheet and applied to 32. My success rate was 0%. But I was not discouraged; I was green and chastised myself for not doing the spreadsheet earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, I entered 140 events in the spreadsheet but only applied to 14. I was busy with the transition between my master\'s and my PhD and had to be more selective with these applications. Just one application had a positive outcome. I was selected to a pricey new music retreat in Croatia that I ultimately could not attend because: a) Vero\'s mental health was deteriorating, and b) I wouldn\'t have been able to afford it anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n### And then...\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter of 2016, I got an email from the [Alba Rosa Viva! Festival](https://albarosavietor.com/en/). They had posted a call for new chamber pieces, which I had responded with *huithrothroy*, an evocative duo for flute and piano based on the [song of the chucao bird](https://xeno-canto.org/species/Scelorchilus-rubecula). They were now requesting a computer-made realization of *huithrothroy*. \\r\\n\\r\\nI thought it was odd that they\'d want a computer realization of the piece; it could never make justice to an actual performance by human beings (which I didn\'t have because they wanted an un-premiered piece). Anyway, I sent them the audio file as requested. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few weeks later, Alba Rosa Viva! informed me that I had been selected as one of five finalists in the festival, and that my piece would be performed in early October 2016 in Utrecht, Netherlands. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"It\'s happening!,\\" I told Vero in excitement. \\"It\'s finally happening! I can\'t believe it! This is it! This is the true beginning of my career!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n## A year of hope\\r\\n\\r\\nI got three more wins that spring:\\r\\n\\r\\n- I was invited to attend the [Bozzini Lab](https://quatuorbozzini.ca/en/projets/bozzini_lab) in Vancouver, BC, where I\'d collaborate with the [Quatuor Bozzini](https://quatuorbozzini.ca/en) in producing an experimental new piece for string quartet.\\r\\n- I was accepted into [The Walden School](https://waldenschool.org/)\'s week-long [Creative Musicians Retreat](https://waldenschool.org/creative-musicians-retreat/) in New Hampshire, where I would meet dozens of composers, performers, improvisers, choral directors, etc.\\r\\n- *Interlude (Between Bite and Kiss)*, a duo for guitar and left-hand piano inspired by the incredible work of [Alex Caldiero](https://thesonosopher.com/caldiero-vita), won a call for scores by a Japanese publisher, and it would be premiered later that year in Kyoto.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also participated in the [June in Buffalo](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/music21c/june-in-buffalo.html) festival in 2016, which I was entitled to attend as a PhD student at UB.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Vero\'s aunts\\r\\n\\r\\nVero had three aunts visit us in Amherst in the summer. None of them had ever been to the US. It was an adventure for them and for us. Vero took them to New York City and the [Sacred Grove](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/locations/sacred-grove?lang=eng), then came home a few days before I had to leave for the Creative Musicians Retreat.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retreat had a fun structure: \\r\\n\\r\\n- Day: Lessons, rehearsals, workshops, discussions, and hikes \\r\\n- Evening: Concerts with discussion panels \\r\\n\\r\\nMulti-Grammy\xae winner [Michael Daugherty](https://smtd.umich.edu/profiles/michael-daugherty/) was the composer-in-residence at the Retreat that year and led the discussion panels in the evening concerts. After my piece was played, he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"What kind of torture are the likes of you and Haas trying to inflict on us?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was just banter. The audience laughed, the performers laughed, but the biggest grin was my own\u2014I **loved** being mentioned in the same breath as the legendary [Georg Friedrich Haas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Friedrich_Haas).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Trip to the Netherlands\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late September, I went to Utrecht via the now defunct [WOW Air](https://wowair.com/). The airfare was cheap, but it had a catch: there was a day-long stopover in Reykjav\xedk between Toronto and Amsterdam. Since I\'d long been fascinated with [Iceland and Vikings](/my-story/8-graduation-u-of-u.md#its-all-done), the stopover was a plus for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Reykjav\xedk\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight to Iceland was a red-eye. When we were near Greenland, a flight attendant announced that the aurora borealis was visible from my side of the airplane. I was tired and my eyes hurt, but seeing the aurora was still magical.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived in Iceland before sunrise. When I boarded the shuttle from the airport to the city, the driver said, \\"Good morning,\\" in English. I greeted her in Icelandic and she immediately switched to Icelandic. I must\'ve sounded convincing enough, but that\'s all I had learned: greetings. She then asked me a question, I confessed I didn\'t actually speak Icelandic, she looked annoyed, and switched back to English. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Where are you going?\\" She repeated herself in a language I could understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Erm... Reykjav\xedk?\\", I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Yes, but *where* in Reykjav\xedk?\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nShe was exasperated. It was early, I had tricked her about my Icelandic proficiency, and now I was holding up the queue. I couldn\'t give her a definitive answer, so I just went all the way to the final stop. It was close to the iconic [Hallsgr\xedmskirkja](https://www.hallgrimskirkja.is/en), so it worked out well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked everywhere in Reykjav\xedk and had a great time. How could a world capital be so quaint. My brief stopover also coincided with the first of the [Nordic Music Days](https://nordicmusicdays.org/), a new music festival, so I attended that evening\'s events at [Harpa Concert Hall](https://www.harpa.is/en/).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Utrecht\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I finally made it to the Netherlands, I spent a couple of hours exploring Amsterdam before going to my Airbnb in Vleuten, a few km from Utrecht\'s city centre. The following couple of days were filled with rehearsals, stroopwafel, shawarma, and getting to know the other finalists and the competition\'s organizers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe concert that featured the works of all finalists took place in a cathedral. Everything looked and sounded beautiful. Much to my surprise, *huithrothroy* placed 2nd in the competition. I was eating hors-d\'\u0153uvre with the performers when someone came looking for me to tell me I\'d won something. I swallowed quickly and jogged to the stage to receive the prize. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Happy sigh\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessionally, 2016 was a great year for me. My work on the spreadsheet was starting to pay off after more than two years of zero success.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I had good reason to believe that 2017 was going to be good too. The peerless [Arditti Quartet](https://ardittiquartet.com/) was coming to Buffalo in the winter\u2014and they were going to record one of my pieces. \\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn\'t wait. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: The last time I updated this spreadsheet was in 2023. It had almost 800 events in it."},{"id":"more-successes","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/more-successes","source":"@site/my-story/11-more-successes.md","title":"11.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## *Escenas*\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [Music Library](https://library.buffalo.edu/music/) was my happy place at [UB](https://www.buffalo.edu/). Whenever I needed to study, compose, prepare classes, listen to music, I just went to the Library. Sometimes I worked in a cubicle next to the street-facing windows, sometimes I worked on one of their wide solid wood tables. Either way, I was more productive in the Library than at home or in the windowless closet that was my assigned office space. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also have always enjoyed the smell of books, new and old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Library had a large collection of music scores, including much 20th and 21st century music. I often browsed shelves aimlessly until something piqued my interest. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how I discovered [Carola Bauckholt](https://www.carolabauckholt.de/)\'s [String Trio (1994)](https://youtu.be/NZxCgsv26P0?si=OY_2r72wgnXidhMb) in 2016. I fell under the piece\'s spell, and it inspired me to write my own string trio. \\r\\n\\r\\nI called this trio *Escenas* because it was inspired by scenes of my relationship with Samuel. One such scene was watching long compilations of passing trains by [CoasterFan2105](https://www.youtube.com/@CoasterFan2105) on YouTube. We also had fun doing this in person; we\'d go to the Depew Station on Sunday afternoons, sit on the platform benches, and just watch the trains go by. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Arditti residency\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as I learned that the [Arditti Quartet](https://ardittiquartet.com/) would be coming to UB in 2017 to present a concert and and hold a recording session, I added a second violin to *Escenas*. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy trio became a quartet, just like that. That\'s how much I wanted to work with the Arditti Quartet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow students and I were all intimidated by the coming of the \\"Ardittis,\\" as we affectionately called them. In terms of new music, they were (and still are) the pre-eminent string quartet in the world. And they had a reputation for extreme candour and zero tolerance for mistakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Felder](http://www.david-felder.com/) emphasized the importance of being well prepared for the recording session with the Arditti Quartet. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"For example, be careful with the \'Arditti fourth\',\\" he told us. \\"It\'s the tritone between G3 and C\u266f4, which, as you know, is impossible to play on the violin.[^2] Yet, you\'d be surprised at how often it appears in student scores. And it sets off Irvine [Arditti] every time.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father\'s voice echoed in my mind, \\"If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.\\"[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workshop and recording session went as I expected. Some people had a good time, some didn\'t. One person even left the session abruptly and scurried out of the hall because they felt embarrassed. For me, however, things went very well. I had prepared the score of *Escenas* as best as I could, and the Arditti Quartet played it masterfully. \\r\\n\\r\\n### More wins\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recording that came out of this session became a centrepiece in my portfolio, helping me nab two more wins for *Escenas* in 2017:\\r\\n\\r\\n- As a finalist in the [Mivos/Kanter Prize](https://www.mivosquartet.com/12th-mivoskanter-string-quartet-composition-prize) of the [Mivos Quartet](https://www.mivosquartet.com/).\\r\\n- As a finalist in the M\xfasica Hoje contest in my hometown of Curitiba, where it was premiered by the city\'s chamber orchestra in August. The competition\'s director had been my professor at [UFPR](/my-story/1-from-curitiba-to-provo.md#ufpr), so my music had gone \\"full circle\\" since I left Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summertime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spring came and my 2nd year at UB was over. In the summer, two things preoccupied me: teaching an online section of MUS 116 (Music Theory for Non-Majors) and going on a trip with my family to Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\n### YouTube channel\\r\\n\\r\\nBy that point, I had taught MUS 116 several times in person and once online. Vero suggested I should teach it with a wider audience in mind this time and make my lectures [publicly available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@musictheory1017).\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline teaching in 2017 was nothing like what it has become since the pandemic. It was normal for instructors to teach asynchronously via email chains and PDFs. We set deadlines for homework and quizzes, and then marked the students\' submissions. We rarely engaged with students in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nVero\'s suggestion would elevate my course above the glorified newsletter that used to pass for online teaching, but it also meant considerable extra work. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"But if you do it well, it\'ll be good for your resume,\\" she advised. She convinced me. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of the summer term, I published 25 videos about music theory on YouTube. To date, my channel has garnered over 107,000 views. I haven\'t added anything to the channel since that summer, and I don\'t think I ever will, but it has been gratifying to see the scale of the impact my teaching could have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat episode also reinforced to me how important it was to listen to Vero\'s counsel. I have since made many more positive life-changing decisions based on her advice. Writing this story, in fact, is one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cruise\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow, my father found a very good deal on a cruise from Florida to The Bahamas in August, and offered to give us three cruise tickets if we took care of the airfares. We\'d been holding on to a voucher from JetBlue that we got after we volunteered to opt out of an overbooked flight, so flying would also be free for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe accepted my father\'s gift, took a direct flight from Buffalo to Fort Lauderdale, and set up a base in Boca Rat\xf3n. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the cruise departed, we spent several days exploring southern Florida, from Cape Canaveral to Key West. My favourite part of this leg of the trip was visiting NASA\'s [Kennedy Space Center](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/), where we watched a live launch. It was hot, humid, and Samuel cried when everyone started yelling the countdown, but it didn\'t matter; watching the rocket go into space awed us.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOur cruise was very nice, too, but I wasn\'t able to relax as much as I thought I would. On the one hand, it was great to unplug from all responsibilities, loaf around, go for a swim, eat heaps of delicious food, visit paradisiacal islands. This part I really liked.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Incidentally, Samuel slept through the night for the first time EVER during this cruise. What a random place for this milestone.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I felt morally ambivalent about the whole thing. The cruise ship was literally a giant floating casino, and being there felt wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. I also didn\'t like the lazy and gluttonous person I became there. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe I\'m too ascetic.[^3]\\r\\n\\r\\n### Hurricanes\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we came home from the trip, we found out why the cruise tickets had been cheap: August is peak hurricane season in that area. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'d seen a scary storm in Key West, but our cruise was uneventful. Huge cyclones started buffeting the region mere days after we left. In 2017, hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria laid waste to Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, respectively. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were glad to have escaped all of that.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Year 3 (UB)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy biggest concern going into my third year at UB were my upcoming comprehensive exams\u2014or *comps*. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Comps\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the name implies, the comps covered all subjects in musicology, music theory, music history, orchestration, etc. My comps would mark the official end of my coursework, so I was happy not to have to worry about course marks ever again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was advised to set apart six months to study for my comps, so I scheduled them in the spring of 2018 to give me enough time to prepare while also tending to my other responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comps were hard but fair. There were only three questions, and the expectation was that I\'d write (by hand) as much as I could about each topic during the allotted three hours. I took the test in my beloved Music Library, passed, and went from PhD student to PhD candidate. In graduate lingo, I was now *ABD*: all but dissertation.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Pre-school\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the fall of 2017, Samuel qualified to attend a state-sponsored pre-school full time. He struggled at first, but the pre-school\'s caring staff helped him adapt to the new social environment and grow. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pre-school was adjacent to the UB campus, and was an annex of a retirement community. I volunteered there once or twice a week to help clean up messes and play songs on the guitar for the kids. One time, Samuel and I even performed a little concert on the piano for his classmates and some of the elderly residents. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing with my son in his pre-school was the highlight of my week.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that Samuel had started going to school and the end of my PhD was in sight, I started to feel a familiar itch: it was time for a new baby. How cool would it be have a picture holding **two children** while wearing my PhD regalia at convocation? \\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: [Doctrine and Covenants 38:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p30#p30).\\r\\n[^2]: The lowest open string on the violin is a G3. The next open string is a D4, above C\u266f4. Since violinists can only produce one note per string, and C\u266f4 can only be played on the G string, the Arditti fourth is impossible to play without a *scordatura*, i.e., a non-standard tuning of the violin\'s strings.\\r\\n[^3]: No, I did not misspell \\"autistic.\\" Although that would also be true."},{"id":"elias","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/elias","source":"@site/my-story/12-elias.md","title":"12.

For this special birthday, I wanted to give my wife two presents:\\r\\n\\r\\n- An original song\\r\\n- A trip\\r\\n\\r\\n### Song\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter writing and practicing [\\"Sin pies ni cabeza\\"](https://youtu.be/D7G-wQx1XPY?si=bFCJwgmIyFZf2sCc) for about two weeks, I recorded it in a single take in the basement studio of a good friend of mine. I then combed through our family\'s external hard drives to make a montage with the videos we had of Vero to go along with the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m satisfied with the music video, even though the recording and my singing are somewhat rough around the edges. And I think Vero enjoyed it, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Trip\\r\\n\\r\\nVero loves travelling so I wanted to plan a surprise trip for her birthday. I thought we should go to Canada, but just crossing the border and going to a place like [Niagara-on-the-Lake](https://www.visitniagaracanada.com/region/niagara-on-the-lake/), as lovely as it was, was not going to impress her. We needed to go farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found out that the [Canadian Tulip Festival](https://tulipfestival.ca/) and the Victoria Day celebrations in Ottawa coincided with Vero\'s birthday. Plus, Ottawa seemed like a laid-back city with beautiful scenery and lots of other attractions, and was within a reasonable driving distance from Amherst. I booked an Airbnb in Lebreton Flats, and a week or so before the trip, I told Vero what we were doing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to [Parliament Hill](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/Visit/default/en_CA), the [National Gallery](https://www.gallery.ca/), [Commissioners Park](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/commissioners-park), walked the pathways along the Rideau Canal and the Ottawa River, ate delicious Indian food in the [ByWard Market](https://www.byward-market.com/).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"You know, I wouldn\'t mind living here at some point,\\" I told Vero.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Me neither,\\" she agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three of us fell in love with Ottawa.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, actually, the **four** of us. We\'d soon learn that Vero was pregnant with our second child by then.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Struggling with my weight\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-2018, I realized I had put on a lot of weight since Samuel had been born. I was never one to monitor my weight too closely, but by the latter half of my PhD, it was too visible to ignore. I weighed nearly 90 kg at my heaviest. It doesn\'t sound like much, but for someone who stands 1,69 m tall on a good day, I was technically obese.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I started overeating in response to stress. It was tough balancing my various obligations. I had to: \\r\\n\\r\\n- Care for my wife and son.\\r\\n- Do well in university and finish my PhD before my scholarship dried up.\\r\\n- Be a good teacher to my music theory and history students.\\r\\n- Polish my portfolio so I could get a permanent job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I had to deal with the fact that, in spite of my best efforts in all of the above, the future of our family was still uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn\'t smoke. I couldn\'t drink. I couldn\'t gamble. I couldn\'t splurge. I couldn\'t sleep around. None of the vices other people use to \\"process\\" their anxieties and frustrations were available to me. None except for one: food.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love eating. Nothing boosts my mood quite like a delicious meal with a cold can of pop followed by a delicious dessert. I also love sugary snacks throughout the day and pantry raids in the middle of the night, when everybody else is asleep. \\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t regret loving food; it\'s one of life\'s great pleasures. What I regret is having poor impulse control and failing to stop myself when I know I should. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I gained weight, old clothes became tight and unflattering to my figure, and new clothes were always too big for a short man like me. Getting fat made me anxious, and feeling anxious made me overeat even more. Vero was disappointed in me, and I could sense she was becoming less attracted to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, I never let my bad physique get in the way of my happiness, so I trudged on relatively well, hoping that I\'d eventually lose the extra weight when things got easier after my PhD.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Europe again\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 2018, I was selected to participate in the [Voix Nouvelles](https://www.royaumont.com/evenement/academie-voix-nouvelles-fsc18/) academy at the [Royaumont abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royaumont_Abbey) north of Paris. Vero and I decided to turn my going to France into a family trip, so I booked a flight for the three of us to London Heathrow two weeks before my residency started.\\r\\n\\r\\n### London\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent one week in London, discovering the city by bus, train, and on foot. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Airbnb was in Crystal Palace, where we saw the hilariously inaccurate [Iguanodon sculptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_Dinosaurs) in the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were dazzled by [Westminster Cathedral](https://westminstercathedral.org.uk/). \\r\\n\\r\\nWe ate fish and chips made by Portuguese immigrants near the [Tower Bridge](https://www.towerbridge.org.uk/). It was cool to speak my mother tongue in an unexpected place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe poked fun at the tourists waiting in a super long line to go into a [Shrek-themed attraction](https://www.shreksadventure.com/) near the [London Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye). With so many things to see and do in London... Shrek? That\'s what they had travelled however many kilometres for? And who did the attraction appeal to? By then, *Shrek* was too old to be liked by kids, and not old enough to be liked by their parents, so we refused to believe people had planned to go there; they were just wondering the area and got sucked into the queue by the colourful facade.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Paris\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen our time in London was up, we set out for Paris via Eurostar. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn my ignorance, I thought that when the train crossed the English Channel, it\'d be like an aquarium tunnel and we\'d see all sorts of marine life swimming around us. Imagine my disappointment when we emerged in Calais and I realized that the walls of the Channel Tunnel were (obviously) made of reinforced concrete and were therefore totally opaque. \\r\\n\\r\\nVero had a good laugh, and I felt good because I made her happy with my silliness.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Disillusionment\\r\\n\\r\\nWe liked Paris less than we liked London. We stayed in Belleville, but it was not very *belle*. Paris was dirtier than we thought and the people were not very kind. I even got into a few arguments\u2014in French! I was also surprised by the lack of trees on the streets. \\r\\n\\r\\n*They conquered half the world for hundreds of years, and what do they have to show for it? Where did all the wealth they plundered go?*, we wondered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we went to Versailles. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Oh, that\'s where.*\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn\'t all bad, of course. The city\'s architecture was breathtaking, and Samuel and I enjoyed playing with toy boats in the pond at the [Palais du Luxembourg](https://www.senat.fr/lng/en/the-luxembourg-palace.html). \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, though, we felt that Paris had the dysfunction we saw in Latin America but none of its human warmth. In fact, I\'ll gladly take Curitiba over Paris any day.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### \\"New voices\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week in Paris, Vero and Samuel went back home, and I took a train 30 km north to the Royaumont abbey for my month-long composition residency. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur schedule at Voix Nouvelles consisted of attending lessons, seminars, and rehearsals. And writing music. Writing, re-writing, re-re-writing. I went up to the abbey\'s scriptorium as frequently as I could to work on my manuscript, just like generations of monks had done before. The new piece that came out of this process, *Courante*, was premiered in a concert toward the end of the residency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole thing was magical. The setting, the events, my fellow students, our mentors, the ensembles we worked with. My favourite part was sitting in the [Potager-Jardin](https://www.royaumont.com/decouvrir-labbaye/les-jardins/le-potager-jardin/) (\\"vegetable garden\\") and listening to [Jean-Luc Herv\xe9](http://jeanlucherve.com/)\'s [*Germination*](https://youtu.be/HeB__NlXU9w?si=QMVXEZ4mKaPVVZs7) sound installation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI constantly felt like the lowest rung on the ladder there, but that made me feel privileged rather than demoralized.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Year 4 (UB)\\r\\n\\r\\nI rejoined my family in Amherst shortly after the fall semester had already started at UB. Graduating was a foregone conclusion, so my main concern became finding a job. Seven years after coming up with my [career \\"roadmap\\"](/my-story/5-marriage.md#fear-of-failure), I was finally ready for step 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew that universities and colleges typically posted academic jobs 9-12 months before their start date, so I had no time to lose. I re-purposed my [competition spreadsheet](/my-story/10-first-real-successes.md#the-spreadsheet) into a job application spreadsheet and started logging all the relevant job postings that I could find in the US, Canada, and elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nI applied to dozens and dozens of jobs that fall and got two interviews, one at [SUNY Potsdam](https://www.potsdam.edu/academics/crane-school-music) and the other at [BYU](https://music.byu.edu/), my [alma mater](/my-story/1-from-curitiba-to-provo.md#provo-bound). \\r\\n\\r\\nNeither panned out, so I kept applying.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Elias\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Vero\'s pregnancy was advancing. We now had access to health insurance, so Vero received much better care in Buffalo than she had in Utah. When her OB/GYN learned of Samuel\'s difficult birth, they ordered more tests than usual, prescribed her some medicine, and recommended frequent bed rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt worked. The baby grew well and healthy until he decided to be born in the winter of 2019, four weeks early. We called him Elias, the Greek version of Elijah. It works well in Portuguese, Spanish, and English and it represents the connection we feel to our ancestors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was snowy when Elias was born, but I felt warm and awash with love, and even though he was technically a preemie, he had no issues and had to spend just a day or two at Sisters of Charity Hospital before coming home.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike his older brother before him, Elias filled my life with tenderness, perspective, and purpose. Even at that early stage, I could tell he was different from Samuel and I was excited to see how the two boys would grow up and lean on each other for friendship and comfort."},{"id":"graduation-ub","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/graduation-ub","source":"@site/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md","title":"13.

I couldn\'t believe that their tour stop in Buffalo should coincide with the presentation of my dissertation piece. Since UB was sponsoring ELISION\'s coming, I asked Felder whether I could have them play my dissertation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"OK... but they\'re bringing a weird band,\\" he said. \\"Weird even by their standards.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Weird how?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I\'ll send you their email. It\'s an octet or nonet with things like drums, lap steel guitar, uillean pipes... if you write for them, your piece won\'t have much of a performance life. It\'ll be one-and-done.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s safer for composers to write for common instrumental groupings (and their subsets) because this increases the likelihood of the piece being picked up by multiple ensembles. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut writing music was never about playing it safe for me. New music is already a weird field; if my dissertation piece was going to be played only once, I might as well make it so weird it\'d be impossible to replicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote a recited monodrama based on the poetry of [Ferreira Gullar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferreira_Gullar) for actor, stage props, an 8-piece chamber ensemble, and a fixed-media track. I called it [*Noturno*](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2303837514?sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses), and premiered it alongside ELISION in April 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis collaboration with ELISION remains the highest honour of my career.[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\n## Now what?\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long thereafter, I successfully defended my dissertation and was awarded my PhD. UB\'s commencement ceremony took place on Vero\'s 31st birthday, and my parents and an uncle and aunt from Utah flew in to be with us that day. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the ceremony, Vero took a picture of me in my PhD regalia holding our sons, one on each arm, in front of a beautiful cherry blossom on campus. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust like I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was done. My 13-year-long post-secondary journey that had started in 2006 was finally over. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut my satisfaction evaporated quickly; I didn\'t have a job lined up, and none of what I\'d achieved in prior years mattered if I couldn\'t secure a job offer. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Whew!\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks after my graduation, my [I-20](/my-story/9-from-orem-to-buffalo.md#about-visas) expired and our family entered the grace period of my immigration status. I had to land a job in three months or leave the US.[^2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, well into the summer of 2019, a miracle. UB needed to replace a music theory professor who was retiring, and they offered me the gig. I don\'t know why they waited that long to find a replacement, but their procrastination played to my advantage. I\'d already taught music theory there for years, I got along with the other theory instructor in the department, and they needed someone ASAP.\\r\\n\\r\\nUB offered me a one-year contract to start in the fall and assigned me the role of full-time Clinical Assistant Professor in the Music Department. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a relief! Our family was back on track. I sent all the required paperwork to the [US Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/) (USCIS), and waited for my employment authorization document (EAD) to arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried not to worry too much about 2020. I\'d continue to do my best and things would work out like they had hitherto done. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Move\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike what I earned as a teaching assistant, my new job would pay me a living wage, so Vero and I decided to move out of our apartment and rent a house with a yard. After years of barely scraping by, we felt we were moving up and our family deserved a better home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hindsight, moving was not a good idea. Our rent doubled, the house was infested with mice, and I didn\'t know that what we did to or in our yard would matter to anyone but ourselves. In fact, when our tenancy was over, our landlady chose to keep our deposit mainly because I let thistles grow on a thin strip of soil between our driveway and the neighbour\'s fence.[^3] \\r\\n\\r\\n## Now what??\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the worst consequence of moving was missing the delivery of my EAD, which had been sent to our old apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Stop\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, I didn\'t think this was a big deal.\\r\\n\\r\\n*USCIS says I\'m legally entitled to work. All the paperwork has been cleared. I\'m just missing the actual card, which should be arriving at my correct address soon because I set up a forwarding address with USPS.*\\r\\n\\r\\nI shared my mailing snag with the Human Resources person in the Music Department, and assured them that there was enough time for my EAD to bounce between USCIS\'s return address in Missouri and my new address in Amherst before classes started. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"In the meantime,\\" I added, \\"here\'s a print-out from the USCIS website that states that I\'m authorized to work. Just in case.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the EAD did *not* arrive before classes started, but the HR rep seemed satisfied with the print-out, and I started working. A few days into the semester, however, they sought me, frantically, while I was teaching a class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"You have to stop *right now* and go home,\\" they said. \\"I\'ve just been told that you absolutely cannot work until you bring me your physical EAD. No other document will do.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Doesn\'t the print-out I gave you already have all the information you need?,\\" I asked. \\"It has my USCIS number and the EAD\'s duration. That should be enough for you to check that I\'m OK to work with [E-Verify](https://www.e-verify.gov/), no?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I don\'t know about that. What I *do* know is that I need your EAD. It\'s the law. There\'s no other way. We\'ll find a replacement for you while you wait for the card to arrive. But now you need to go.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe department was willing to wait for my EAD because they knew this debacle could\'ve been avoided if they hadn\'t waited until the middle of the summer to offer me the job.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Wait\\r\\n\\r\\nDays started passing, and there was no update on the USCIS website about them re-sending my EAD. Why was it taking so long?!\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to believe that there was a chance that I\'d never get my EAD, or that I\'d get it so late I\'d lose my job. Then it\'d be game-over for my career and our family\'s future in the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur family was also running out of money very quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn\'t just sit on my hands. Even though USCIS makes it virtually impossible to seek help from other human beings, I called their phone number every day and sat on the line for hours hoping to talk to someone to whom I could plead my case.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I pressed 2 for Spanish in the USCIS phone line. Maybe there\'d be less traffic. Maybe it\'d be easier to tug at the heartstrings of my fellow Latin Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nI learned which Church wards were close to the USCIS office in Missouri, and got in touch with their bishops. Maybe there were members in those wards who worked for USCIS and could intercede for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI even pestered USCIS employees on their social media accounts after doing some online sleuthing. \\r\\n\\r\\nNothing worked.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody helped. \\r\\n\\r\\nI begged and grovelled and abased myself to no avail. It was harrowing. Vero and I were both losing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Now what???\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, a few weeks later, the EAD finally arrived. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust like that, unceremoniously. I took it to the HR rep, they photocopied it, and I was cleared to work again.\\r\\n\\r\\n### UB reprise\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ordeal with my EAD had broken me, but the fall semester was in full swing at UB, so I shook off the trauma and moved on.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching at UB was fun and fulfilling. I\'d become an engaging educator after teaching there for four years, and I had great rapport with my students. I was in my element.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I really came into my own in my second term there, when I was assigned to modernize [MUS 116](/my-story/9-from-orem-to-buffalo.md#ub-year-1) to try and reverse its dropping enrolment rate. I even published an [academic essay](https://ojs.library.osu.edu/index.php/engagingstudents/article/view/7694/6331) about this experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to build my career at UB. I had dreams of becoming a real researcher with a focus on video game music and accessibility in music theory pedagogy. I wanted to keep composing music and collaborating with the amazing musicians and ensembles that passed through Buffalo. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore than anything, I wanted our family to put down roots in Amherst. Vero was happier than she\'d ever been in Utah, and we both looked forward to raising our boys there.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A faint hope\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. New York state declared a hiring freeze, and I was told UB would not renew my contract or sponsor my H1-B.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was let down, but not surprised. \\r\\n\\r\\nI figured this might happen, so I kept applying to jobs at other institutions during my time at UB. By that point, I must\'ve applied to 120 jobs since the fall of 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nI only got one interview, at [Erie Community College](https://www.ecc.edu/) (ECC). It was an adjunct gig to teach a single course, but I wanted to get it because it\'d tide us over till I found something more permanent. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether ECC would be able to sponsor my H1-B became a non-issue when they got back to me a few days later to inform me that they\'d chosen another candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\n### End of the line\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was it. Time was up. We needed to pack our bags and leave the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut go where?\\r\\n\\r\\n- Concepci\xf3n, where Vero\'s family lived and where she could work as a dentist?; or, \\r\\n- Curitiba, where my parents owned a fully furnished apartment that we could live in rent-free while we regrouped?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more Vero and I discussed our family\'s next steps, the clearer a third option became: why not Canada? \\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: As Felder predicted, *Noturno* was never played again after its premiere.\\r\\n[^2]: Vero and I never considered staying illegally in the country. It was impossible to work undocumented in New York state except in some questionable off-the-books arrangements like informal gigs or as a day labourer. We were also scared overstaying our visa would compromise our future chances to obtain a proper work permit.\\r\\n[^3]: We took our landlady to court and won, but the ordeal was very unpleasant all the same."},{"id":"from-amherst-to-curitiba","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/from-amherst-to-curitiba","source":"@site/my-story/14-from-amherst-to-curitiba.md","title":"14.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## \\"Express\\" entry\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the span of a week in the spring of 2020, Vero and I went from hoping things would miraculously work out in the US to losing all hope to wholeheartedly deciding to go to Canada instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we decided to go to Canada, Vero started reading every government webpage and blog post she could find about the immigration process. If she didn\'t understand something, she popped the question in one of the Facebook groups that she\'d joined and get an answer in minutes.[^1] She would then relay what she\'d learned to me. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Points\\r\\n\\r\\nVero told me that our safest best was entering the [Federal Skilled Worker](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html) program in the [Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) system. This process would require every last penny we had plus a little extra that I\'d have to \\"borrow\\" indefinitely from my mother. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe also explained that people in the Express Entry pool were ranked using a point system, and that points were given according to criteria like age, family size, education, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, every so often, Express Entry would invite the top-ranked candidates to apply for permanent residence.\\r\\n\\r\\n### All or nothing\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"You know what\'s the best part?,\\" she teased me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"No, what\'s the best part?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"If we get an invitation to apply for permanent residence, we\'re basically in. We just need to send our documents, do some medical exams, and wait for them to make sure everything we sent them is legit. The hard part is making the cut.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Can you imagine what a relief that would be? Permanent residence. But how hard is it for us to get enough points?\\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"It\'s... doable, but not easy.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nVero had been tracking the cut-off scores of past rounds of invitations. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Your PhD helps, our savings help, but we still need to get perfect marks in the English test,\\" she explained. \\"And we need to do it soon, because I think the cut-off scores are getting higher, and may soon be out of reach for us.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"So... we need to go all in, right now. Are you sure you wanna do it?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I am,\\" she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Then I am too,\\" I said, leaning on her confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n### \xab Tu parles fran\xe7ais, n\'est-ce pas ? \xbb\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"There\'s just one thing,\\" she mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"What?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"If you get good marks on the French test, our profile will be much better ranked.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I don\'t speak French. I picked up a few things when we went to [Paris](/my-story/12-elias.md#paris), but I really don\'t speak French.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I know. But you can learn it. You have two months.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI trusted Vero and booked my [*Test de connaissance du fran\xe7ais*](https://apprendre.tv5monde.com/en/tcf) (TCF) that same night, not knowing how to speak French. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was done with work at UB, so I started using Duolingo and watching French shows and movies on Netflix for hours on end, every day. \\r\\n\\r\\nEight weeks later, between Independence Day and the *prise de la Bastille*, I drove 11 hours down to Raleigh, NC, whose [Alliance fran\xe7aise](https://www.afraleigh.org/page/1642293-home) was the only place close-ish to us that was offering the TCF in the middle of the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Biding our time\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the results of our language proficiency tests came back, we were relieved. Vero and I got the scores we needed in English, and even though I didn\'t do well in my oral interview in French, I got top marks in *compr\xe9hension \xe9crite et orale*. This put us in the Express Entry safe zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'d read that the typical Express Entry process took six months from submitting one\'s profile to getting approved for permanent residence. We had four months left in the US, and a part of me hoped we\'d get lucky and have our application processed faster than usual. \\r\\n\\r\\nI just wanted to hop across the border and end the instability in our life.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Curitiba, again\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter coming back from Raleigh, I spent the rest of the summer taking my sons on long walks around our neighbourhood. We especially liked getting cold treats at the 7-Eleven nearby and playing in [Dellwood Park](https://www.amherst.ny.us/content/parks_detail.php?park_num=park_0021).\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, it became obvious that we wouldn\'t be able to go straight from the US to Canada. We needed to go back to Curitiba, where we had a solid support system, and wait out the processing of our application there.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Last month in the US\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after we bought our flight tickets, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) invited us to apply for permanent residence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe felt victorious, but there was no time to celebrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent our last month in the US selling or giving away our possessions. We could only fit so much in our four suitcases, and we prioritized clothing and items with sentimental value; everything else had to stay behind. We also ran around to gather some additional documents that IRCC was requesting. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\'t know how long it\'d take for Canada to accept our application, but we hoped our sojourn in Curitiba would be short.\\r\\n\\r\\n### The TWA Hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I researched flight tickets online, I realized that if we booked a flight from Buffalo-Curitiba on the same ticket, it would be:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Very tiring \\r\\n- More expensive than booking Buffalo-JFK and JFK-Curitiba as separate tickets \\r\\n\\r\\nSo I thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n*Why not do Buffalo-JFK on one day and just... take our time there? We can use the money we\'d save from not buying a single ticket to stay at a hotel and fly to Brazil the next day.*\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed at the recently renovated [TWA Hotel](https://www.twahotel.com/), and it was magical. Like [*Marvelous Mrs. Maisel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Mrs._Maisel) magical. The retro architecture and decor, the red carpets, the rooftop infinity pool, the views of the runways, the clickety-clack of the split-flap display in the sunken lounge.[^2] Everything was awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly, I\'m still proud of that idea. Our family was in no rush to return to Brazil, so we were glad to exchange expediency for comfort and some memory-making. It turned a stressful move into a fun trip.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Mixed feelings\\r\\n\\r\\nTravelling in the pandemic was a pain, but we made it to Curitiba without any problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'d forgotten how much I loved my hometown. It\'s beautiful, convenient, and vibrant. I felt silly for believing that going back to Brazil was a punishment for failing. It wasn\'t. Curitiba is an objectively better city to live in than most places in the US. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith one caveat: safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s not uncommon for people to be robbed or have their homes burglarized in Brazil. In fact, there was a break-in in our apartment complex the first week we were there, but our super caught them on camera and called the police, who came to arrest them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a second caveat: good education is expensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe enrolled Samuel in a public school in a somewhat sketchy neighbourhood. Since classes were online due to the pandemic, we weren\'t worried about his safety in school or the quality of the education he got. But had we stayed in Curitiba long enough for the pandemic restrictions to be lifted, we would\'ve had to transfer him to a private school.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in the US or Canada was really just a way for us to enable our children to grow up safely and with access to good education. In most other regards, I like living in Brazil better, and Vero feels most at home in Chile.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Job worries\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Canadian permanent residence application was stuck, and I came to terms with being in Curitiba for the foreseeable future, so I spent the rest of 2020 looking for a job.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Job counselling\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing I did was talk to an employment specialist at the city\'s Workers\' Agency. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\'d seen on TV how well employment agencies worked in Scandinavia. I thought that an employment agent would see my experience and potential, pull some strings, and find me a position in the hidden job market.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor better or worse, Brazil is not Sweden. The agent I talked to didn\'t know what a doctorate was, was not impressed by the languages I spoke, said that I had no real skills, and insisted that I should get a dead-end minimum wage job.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot very helpful. I had to revive my [job application spreadsheet](/my-story/12-elias.md#year-4-ub) and do the legwork myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Translator interview\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon landed an interview to be a trilingual translator of patents and technical diagrams. I did well in the interview and the practical test, but the company ghosted me afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Music professor interview 1\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, my beloved [Belas](/my-story/1-from-curitiba-to-provo.md#belas), which by then had been incorporated into a state university, posted an opening with a job description that fit my profile perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nCuriously, the chairperson of the hiring committee was a UB alumnus and a former student of [David Felder](http://www.david-felder.com/)\u2014just like me!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything worked in my favour, but I still didn\'t get the job. Job openings in public institutions in Brazil are vied for like contests, and I placed 3rd. The person in 1st place scored so much better than everyone else that I felt like the contest might\'ve been a formality to hire a pre-selected candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Music professor interview 2\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2020, a friend from UB who lived and worked in Chile told me that I was a great match for an opening at the [Universidad Austral de Chile](https://www.uach.cl/) (UACh). I applied, got an interview, and aced it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I accepted their job offer.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Vero learned so much about immigrating to Canada in 2020 that I felt she was as knowledgeable as an immigration lawyer.\\r\\n[^2]: I\'m sad to see that many guests have posted scathing reviews on [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616325-d17741149-Reviews-TWA_Hotel-Queens_New_York.html#review_952355583) in recent years; our experience was super positive."},{"id":"from-curitiba-to-valdivia","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/from-curitiba-to-valdivia","source":"@site/my-story/15-from-curitiba-to-valdivia.md","title":"15.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## UACh (Year 1)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2021, I was hired as *Profesor Auxiliar* at [UACh](https://www.uach.cl/)\'s [School of Music and Sound Arts](https://arquitectura-artes.uach.cl/escuela-de-artes-musicales-y-sonoras/). I was offered a one-year contract with the possibility of renewal pending a positive performance review and a unanimous vote by my fellow faculty members. On the third renewal, my contract would be made indeterminate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTenure track, essentially. This was the equivalent of a tenure-track job in one of Chile\'s [traditional universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Traditional_Universities). A stable and promising position in academia, a mirage that I\'d been pursuing for so long, had suddenly become a reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\'s more, this career opportunity would also help my wife feel happier. When we were in the US, Vero often expressed how much she missed living in Chile, being close to her family, and working as a dentist. Chile is where she felt like her truest self.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Concepci\xf3n\\r\\n\\r\\nUACh was not holding any in-person classes then due to COVID-related restrictions, so we decided that our family should stay in Curitiba while I worked for UACh. It made economic sense. Our expenses in Brazil were minimal, and the exchange rate between Chilean pesos and reais favoured us. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I still needed to get a work permit, ID, and bank account in Chile, so I travelled solo to Concepci\xf3n in February to stayed with my in-laws while I waited for Migraciones and Registro Civil to process my paperwork. As soon as I got what I needed, I went back to Curitiba. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Curitiba\\r\\n\\r\\nApartments in Brazil typically have a \\"service area\\" with the hookups for laundry appliances, a large sink with a built-in washboard called *tanque*, and a bathroom. Occasionally, service areas also have a small room that people use as a pantry or as a simple bedroom for live-in maids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service area in our apartment in Curitiba had such a room, and we used it as Elias\'s bedroom. It had a crib, a lamp, a white noise machine, a smart camera, and a space heater for cold nights. It was bare, but he slept well there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got the job at UACh, we sold Elias\'s crib and put him to sleep in a trundle bed in Samuel\'s bedroom\u2014like my brother and I had done when we were kids\u2014so I could set up an office in the service area room. I kept the lamp, added a cheap folding table as my desk, and secluded myself there every day as I taught music courses via Zoom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy work arrangement suited me. I worked hard, I taught my students with care, and I composed and recorded several new works. I even released an [extended play](https://igorcoelhoasmarques.bandcamp.com/album/glosolalia).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got off work, I spent time with Vero and the boys visiting my parents or taking strolls around our neighbourhood. I enjoyed being a part of that community, where there was a grocer, a baker, a barber, a butcher, and other people who knew me and on whom I could rely for our everyday needs. There was even an *itamae* three blocks from our place who made the best sushi I\'ve ever had anywhere![^1] \\r\\n\\r\\nI think that if I could\'ve kept working in Chile indefinitely while living in Brazil, we might\'ve dropped the idea of going to Canada altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Linares\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, working in a country and living in another is not really possible without dual citizenship and people willing to run errands for you on the other side. We knew our time in Curitiba was running out, but it wasn\'t clear how soon UACh would return to in-person classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I heard rumblings that in-person activities at UACh might resume in the spring (September-December), Vero and I pre-emptively booked our family\'s tickets to Chile. Her sister Karina lived in [Linares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linares,_Chile), a medium-sized town in [Maule Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maule_Region), and offered to share her house with us while we waited for UACh to make an official announcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf UACh reinstated in-person classes, we\'d already be in Chile, and thus ready to move to Valdivia. If they didn\'t, we\'d visit Vero\'s family in Linares and Concepci\xf3n and then go back to Brazil. Either way, our family was looking forward to spending the week-long [*Fiestas Patrias* holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiestas_Patrias_(Chile)) with Vero\'s family, something she\'d been wanting to do since she [left Chile](/6-graduation-byu.md#veros-graduation) in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Working from (not my) home\\r\\n\\r\\nKarina, her husband, and their two children were the most wonderful and patient hosts. Being with them was always pleasant, and I enjoyed our evenings together in particular, when we chatted, ate take-out, and solved jigsaw puzzles. \\r\\n\\r\\nKarina\'s family ceded a room upstairs for me to use as an ad-hoc office. The room looked east and had a large window, so I could see the snowy Andes from there on a clear day. Every dusk, I also saw dozens of Chilean swallows swooping up and down in the air and feeding in the little park across the street. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou couldn\'t beat my office view.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Paso Pehuenche\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highlight of our trip to Linares was going with all of Vero\'s family to the [Paso Pehuenche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paso_Pehuenche), an Andean pass that leads to Argentina. We had a picnic by the [Maule river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maule_River) and then went up the mountain as far as the road would take us and parked right before the international border crossing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel and I hiked up a nearby ridge, away from the people playing in the snow near the road. When we made it to the top, the majesty of the Andes overwhelmed me. It was beautiful beyond words.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what did we do to mark this special moment? \\r\\n\\r\\nWe peed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat\'s right. He wanted to go, I wanted to go, there was absolutely nobody around, so I told him, \\"Let\'s just do it here. Just aim toward Argentina, maybe the wind will take your pee all the way over there!\\" He laughed so hard he nearly peed himself before he could pee on the Andes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this day I\'ll sometimes ask Samuel, \\"Remember when we *peed* on the Andes? That was wild!\\" He acts like he doesn\'t remember it, though.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Christmas\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral weeks into our stay in Linares, UACh confirmed that in-person classes would only return in 2022, so we flew back to Curitiba in October. We then spent our last months in Brazil getting ready for the holidays and for our imminent move to Valdivia shortly thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Christmas, I made a [*ti\xf3 de Nadal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%C3%B3_de_Nadal) for Samuel and Elias, a silly Catalan tradition where an anthropomorphized log poops out presents for kids. When Samuel saw that the ti\xf3 had pooped a [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/) during our Christmas Eve party, he screamed in happiness and started freaking out, much like I\'d done when I\'d gotten my Nintendo 64 a quarter of a century earlier. Elias didn\'t quite understand what was going on, but he was happy to share in his brother\'s excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur family has loved playing the Switch ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 10th anniversary\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2021, between Christmas and New Year\'s, Vero and I celebrated our 10th anniversary\u2014our *family birthday*, as Vero\'s called it since Samuel was born. I wanted an unforgettable celebration for this special milestone, so I asked my mother to watch the boys for a couple of days while Vero and I went to Ponta Grossa, about 120 km west of Curitiba.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Buraco do Padre\\r\\n\\r\\nWe visited two geological sites near Ponta Grossa: [Vila Velha State Park](https://parquevilavelha.com.br/) with its towering rock formations and [Campos Gerais National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campos_Gerais_National_Park), which had slot canyons and a cave with a 40 m-tall skylight and its own waterfall called [*Buraco do Padre*](https://buracodopadre.com.br/atracao/furna-buraco-do-padre/) (\\"The Priest\'s Hole\\").[^2] \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople call Buraco do Padre an \\"underground amphitheatre\\" because the shallow pool created by the waterfall is surrounded by large rocks where people can sit and observe the hundreds of [biscutate swifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscutate_swift) flying to and from their nests in the crevices of the cave walls. I was awestruck by the din they made. Then, when we waded in the shallow pool, fresh-water crustaceans skittered around our feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was glorious.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tchau, Brasil!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2022, we left Brazil for good. It was our second big, life-changing, international move in a little over a year. I was tired but motivated by my work at UACh and Vero\'s excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Let it be known that I\'ve never been to Japan.\\r\\n[^2]: It doesn\'t as bad in Portuguese as it does in English."},{"id":"from-valdivia-to-ottawa","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/from-valdivia-to-ottawa","source":"@site/my-story/16-from-valdivia-to-ottawa.md","title":"16.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## \xa1Hola, Valdivia!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived in Chile, Vero and the boys stayed with Karina\'s family in Linares while I went down to Valdivia with Felipe, Vero\'s brother, to furnish the apartment we had rented sight unseen. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was only away for a few days, but Elias didn\'t take my absence well and side-eyed me for weeks thereafter, clinging to Vero.\\r\\n\\r\\n## About Samuel\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a month after our family had moved to Valdivia, Samuel turned eight years old. The baby who\'d [struggled to be born](/7-samuel.md#hard-delivery) was now a healthy, active, imaginative, and sensitive boy, and I was immensely proud of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Personality\\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel had taken longer to start talking than most children but was a precocious reader and avidly curious, going from obsessive interest to obsessive interest. First it was trains, next it was black holes, then [*Pok\xe9mon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon).[^1] \\r\\n\\r\\nHe had such an active imagination that when he didn\'t have toys at hand to play out a story he had in his mind, he\'d just use body, gesticulating wildly, narrating, vocalizing all sorts of sound effects. He did this in public, too, without a whiff of self-consciousness, and I never reprimanded him for it. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the contrary, I often praised his imagination because I remember being told that I was too old for certain activities and tastes when I was growing up. Back then, adults thought it was their duty to push boys to maturity as quickly as possible, and since they thought being imaginative was a childish trait, they discouraged it. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Baptism\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning eight is an important milestone for members of the [Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/). We often refer to eight years old as the \\"[age of accountability](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2000/02/the-age-of-accountability-why-am-i-baptized-when-i-am-eight-years-old)\\" because it marks the transition between the total innocence of infancy and early childhood and the growing moral awareness of older children. This means that people older than eight years old are eligible for [baptism](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/baptism) and should strive to make better choices every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, children \\"born in the covenant,\\" i.e., to parents who are active members of the Church, are baptized and confirmed by their fathers on their eighth birthday, and that\'s what Samuel and I did. \\r\\n\\r\\nVero\'s family drove hundreds of km south from Concepci\xf3n and Linares to attend Samuel\'s baptism, and my parents flew in from Brazil. After the baptism, we enjoyed a meal in the mild weather of late summer in southern Chile. It was a happy day for our whole family.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Discipline\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet moments like Samuel\'s baptism make me reflect about my shortcomings as a father.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we [lived in Amherst](/my-story/9-from-orem-to-buffalo.md), I had some misguided ideas about Samuel\'s discipline. He had a penchant for loud meltdowns and I was scared he\'d become a spoiled brat if I didn\'t punish him hard enough. I was never violent, but I could be stern. Sometimes too stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nI regret being like this with Samuel when he was a little child. It\'s so out-of-character for me that I wonder how I was ever capable of acting that way with him. I guess parenting does push one to their limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mistakes I made in my first years as a father eventually made me decide two things:\\r\\n\\r\\n- I will show *and* tell my sons that I love them daily. \\r\\n- I will facilitate positive experiences for my sons so they can remember their childhood with fondness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo hell with the persistent Victorian notion that showing affection to boys \\"coddles\\" them and makes them \\"weak.\\" I want my sons to know that I love them without doubt, and it is this love that will make them strong and resilient.\\r\\n\\r\\n## UACh (Year 2)\\r\\n\\r\\nClasses resumed at UACh in late March. I was invested in the materials that I taught, and students responded well to that. I prioritized content I thought would be equal parts useful and relatable and we played a lot of music in class. I had fun teaching at UACh, I was productive, I supported my fellow faculty members, and my research into video game music was becoming more sophisticated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, my career was taking off.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dilemma\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in the Chilean autumn, more than two years after we had started our [Express Entry process](/my-story/14-from-amherst-to-curitiba.md#points), [IRCC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html) approved our Permanent Residence (PR) in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t know how to feel. Had this come two years earlier, when we were still in Amherst, I would\'ve been ecstatic. But now, so much had changed. After settling in Valdivia and enjoying the start of a promising career, maybe Canada was no longer the best option for our family.\\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I talked, and we agreed that going to Canada would be a setback for our family. She wouldn\'t be able to work as a dentist there, and I would most likely have to reset my career or change careers altogether. We\'d probably burn through our savings until we found our feet in the new country. And we\'d probably never own a home, considering how unaffordable houses are in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the North beckoned to us. It held out a promise of stability, safety, and good education for our sons. Going to Canada felt right.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Second semester\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave my department chair at UACh a six-month notice of my departure, and continued to work, write, compose, and research like I\'d been doing all along. My imminent move didn\'t dampen my creative urges or interfere with my teaching. In my final semester at UACh:\\r\\n\\r\\n- I composed three major works: \\r\\n    - *Venga mi amado* for baroque orchestra, recorded by [Orquesta Barroca Nuevo Mundo](https://orquestanuevomundo.net/orquesta/) and [released by Sello Modular](https://sellomodular.bandcamp.com/album/ra-ces-imaginadas) thanks to a generous grant from the government of Chile.\\r\\n    - *Sea lo que fuere, no lo es* for large choir, premiered in Valdivia\'s main theatre, [Teatro Cervantes](https://teatroregionalcervantes.cl/).\\r\\n    - *Conmutaci\xf3n* for a large ensemble with traditional instruments and found objects, premiered in [Festival Relincha](https://www.relinchafestival.com/), the foremost annual gathering of experimental musicians in southern Chile.\\r\\n- I presented my research findings at a major conference in Valpara\xedso by the [International Association for the Study of Popular Music](https://iaspmal.com/index.php/2023/08/01/fronteras-rutas-horizontes). One of my students at UACh also presented a paper he\'d written under my guidance in this conference.\\r\\n- I was awarded a commission from the [Barlow Endowment](https://barlow.byu.edu/) for a new work for electronically modified piano.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotionally, I kept it together until the end of classes, after which point the complexities of our move started to eat at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where in Canada?\\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I were tired of dragging our suitcases across continents and resetting our lives every so often. This instability was also taking a psychological toll on our sons. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was time to put down roots somewhere, so we made a list of locations in Canada that we saw ourselves living in, from Vancouver to Halifax, and pondered the possibilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe crossed off Qu\xe9bec because we weren\'t allowed to move there; they have their own separate immigration system. We also thought the northern territories would be inhospitable to newcomers with no connections or prior experience in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were weighing the pros and cons of locations in the remaining six provinces, [Red Deer Polytechnic](https://rdpolytech.ca/) (RDP) offered me an adjunct position to teach a three-credit course on popular music. It was quite a downgrade from what I\'d done at [UACh](/my-story/15-from-curitiba-to-valdivia.md#uach-year-1) and [UB](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#ub-reprise), but it represented continuity in my career. And who knows, maybe it would lead to other opportunities. \\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I stopped searching for our family\'s next home because life had made that choice: Red Deer, AB.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Actually, don\'t come to Red Deer, Igor,\\" my supervisor at RDP advised me. \\"Teach this course online and go live some other place. We can only offer you this one course and only once a year. RDP doesn\'t have a music program, and there\'s not much else happening in town. Your career awaits elsewhere.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir candour saved our family a lot of heartache, and I appreciated it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, Vero and I decided to settle in Ottawa because of its moderate size, reputation, amenities, job opportunities, and proximity to two airports with direct flights to South America (Toronto Pearson and Montr\xe9al-Trudeau). \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when people ask me why we\'ve come to Ottawa, I just tell them that I threw a dart at a map of Canada and that\'s where it landed.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Hello bonjour, Ottawa!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left Chile between Christmas and New Year\'s of 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\n### D\xe9j\xe0 vu\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving Chile wasn\'t easy, though. \\r\\n\\r\\nChile\'s federal police, [*Polic\xeda de Investigaciones*](https://pdichile.cl/) (PDI), refused to let us leave the country because of the stupidest technicality: Elias had entered Chile as a Chilean national, so he had to leave Chile as a Chilean national. Because we were going to Canada, that meant that he needed a Chilean passport with a visa to Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we had neither of these documents because we didn\'t need either of these documents. Elias was a US citizen and a permanent resident of Canada, and had his PR stamped on his American passport. This was all we needed to move to Canada. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the PDI officer didn\'t care, and sent us away. Like in our [previous immigration woes](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#wait), we begged and grovelled and abased ourselves to no avail.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting Elias\'s Chilean passport could take months and would likely force us to renew other documents that were set to expire soon. If this ordeal spiralled out of control, we\'d miss our deadline to enter Canada and our PR would be revoked. All our sacrifices would\'ve been for nothing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe needed to find a way around this immigration obstacle ASAP.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New plan\\r\\n\\r\\nWe realized that if we re-booked our flight so that it laid over in a South American country before making it to Canada, Elias could leave Chile with his Chilean ID. No passport needed. Then, we\'d use his American passport with the PR stamp between the intermediary country and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur workaround was viable, but we had to act fast because the window for re-booking our flight was closing. I sat down in an isolated corner of the airport, my phone struggling with low battery, the airline\'s buggy app, and one bar of mobile data. Wi-Fi was even worse. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith tears streaming down my face, I was able to reschedule our flight so that it stopped in Colombia before going to Toronto. I was barely able to do it, but I did it. Vero and I then gathered our suitcases and made our way to the airline\'s baggage counter to drop them off.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Second snag\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got there, the airline\'s ticketing agent barred us from checking in, arguing that we needed visas to enter Canada. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Not this again.* \\r\\n\\r\\nWe insisted that, \\"No, we don\'t actually need visas because we are permanent residents of Canada,\\" and showed them our corroborating documents. But it was fruitless. Like the PDI officer before, the airline agent wouldn\'t budge. We implored them to seek guidance from their supervisor or their counterparts in Colombia and Canada, and sat down on the floor near the check-in counter waiting for a resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nElias and Samuel were distraught and exhausted and didn\'t understand what was going on.\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of hours later, late into the night and a few minutes before our flight\'s boarding closed, the ticketing agent received news about our case and agreed to check us in. Then, at the PDI checkpoint, we handed our tickets to Colombia and our Chilean ID cards to the border officer, and they let us through immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur plan had worked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe bolted for the gate and boarded our flight during the last call. I stowed our carry-on bags in the airplane\'s overhead bins, sat down, let out a big sigh, and vowed never to travel internationally again until I had a Canadian passport.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days later, we were in our new home in Barrhaven, a suburb in southwest Ottawa. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: At the time of writing, Samuel is crazy about [*Kirby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_(series)) and spends virtually all his free time either playing *Kirby* games or reading (WiKirby)[https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_Wiki]."},{"id":"back-to-school","metadata":{"permalink":"/my-story/back-to-school","source":"@site/my-story/17-back-to-school.md","title":"17.

You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) in a different area of this site.* \\r\\n\\r\\n## RDP\\r\\n\\r\\nLife resumed quickly in Canada. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after we landed in the country, Samuel started attending a public school two blocks away from our condo, Vero got a full-time job for the first time since her [residency in 2012](/my-story/5-marriage.md#concepci\xf3n), and I spent my days juggling Elias\'s care and my remote teaching job at [Red Deer Polytechnic](https://rdpolytech.ca/) (RDP).\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of me felt optimistic about this part-time gig at RDP. It kept the momentum of my career going during a difficult international transition and was a way for me to get experience and connections and catalyze future opportunities in Canada. \\r\\n\\r\\n*I landed this job through sheer will, even before setting foot in the country. How much more does Canada have in store for me after I prove what I\'m capable of?*\\r\\n\\r\\nDeep down, however, I feared that RDP was my swan song. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost people with PhDs in music composition\u2014or PhDs, period\u2014don\'t actually work in academia. I got [lucky after graduation](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#whew), and then for four years I struggled through [immigration gauntlets](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#now-what-1) and a [global pandemic](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#a-faint-hope) to keep my academic career alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my luck was running out.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Unemployment\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter arriving in Canada, I applied to a couple dozen jobs with an overhauled resume and curated cover letters. When I noticed that just submitting applications wasn\'t working, I tried sending follow-up messages to the hiring committees, cold emailing prospective colleagues, sending connection requests on LinkedIn to composers, conductors, performers. \\r\\n\\r\\nNobody got back to me. This type of soul-crushing abasement was becoming the common denominator of my 30s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, two or three months after my stint at RDP, I stopped fighting. I wasn\'t interested in a lifelong Sisyphean undertaking anymore. I just wanted peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Vero\'s turn\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my career was falling apart, Vero\'s was blossoming. As a dental assistant, she proved to be such a valuable asset in her team that the scope of her responsibilities kept growing until she became the manager of her practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nVero\'s professional success put us in a socioeconomic stratum I\'d call \\"comfortable working class.\\" Our standards of living were low, we shared a 10-year-old clunker, rarely ate out, couldn\'t afford trips, and our children wore mostly hand-me-downs, but we were debt-free, we always made the rent, and we saved a little each month. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Isolation\\r\\n\\r\\nI was happy to see Vero step up and provide for our family. However, I grieved for my career. I felt rudderless, lonely, misunderstood. I could no longer write music, and I no longer wanted to write music.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, opening up to others doesn\'t really help when you\'re unemployed. Maybe some people find relief in venting, but there was no benefit for me in letting people know of my situation. In fact, sharing my frustration often backfired.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Do something\u2014anything\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I moaned about the derailment of my career, people either implied I wasn\'t trying hard enough or advised me to swallow my pride and start from the bottom somewhere, like as an entry-level employee at a fast-food joint.[^1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s not that I had something against working at McDonald\'s. The issue was that it didn\'t make sense to get a job that earned less than what Vero made. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe when both boys started attending school full time, I could take up part-time shifts at a restaurant. But was that wise? Surely I had some transferable skills that could give me an edge in some field, right?\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Be your own boss\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were also people who projected their unfulfilled entrepreneurial ambitions onto me. One person suggested that I \\"invent a revolutionary piano method for children and sell the textbooks,\\" as if all it took to start a successful company was the vague outline of a good idea. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith no safety net, starting a company was a risky bet with potentially catastrophic consequences. I\'d have to slave away, accumulate debt, neglect my children, and possibly fracture my relationship with my wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard pass.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Hunkering down\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing that I was unemployed with people got me plenty of questionable advice and absolutely no job leads or networking opportunities, so I mostly kept quiet. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also chose to stop applying to jobs and focus on self-improvement and redefining my career goals before jumping back in the job market. I could afford to do that because of Vero\'s support.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Beep, boop\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer, both Samuel and Elias started going to Spanish classes in the morning as part of the [International Languages Program](https://www.ocdsb.ca/continuing_education/international_languages_program) of the [Ottawa-Carleton District School Board](https://www.ocdsb.ca/). \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2.5 hours they were away, I summoned all my strength to teach myself computer programming.\\r\\n\\r\\n*If there\'s one universally transferable skill, it\'s gotta be coding.* \\r\\n\\r\\nI focused on web design and learned a little of Python, Django, YAML, JSON, AJAX, and PostgreSQL for backend work, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend. It was a hard slog, but I made progress every day.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Mudpuppy\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter grasping the basics of programming logic, I began developing an app for Vero to keep track of her clinic\'s inventory. The more I learned, the more I applied what I learned, the more humbled I felt: \\r\\n\\r\\n- There is **so much** to learn that I\'ll probably always feel like an amateur.\\r\\n- There is such a vast ecosystem of languages, programs, libraries, and communities that making programs is 1% original ideas and 99% synthesizing other people\'s work. \\r\\n\\r\\nProgramming was also exciting and empowering.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Vero\'s app became usable, I began to fantasize about its potential. Against my better judgment, I registered a new company, [Mudpuppy](https://www.obrpartner.mgcs.gov.on.ca/onbis/businessnames/viewInstance/view.pub?id=185e6c856f92f2744af3ee5b87a9ed2f9b5f457d273f08c7b86e683c2da07109&_timestamp=1017585962336548), with the intent of eventually commercializing the app.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What if...\\r\\n\\r\\nMudpuppy gave me purpose, but it was only a pet project at this stage. To turn it into something serious, I first needed to acquire real-world experience in Ottawa\'s tech sector\u2014which was unlikely to happen because I was an auto-didact with knowledge gaps and no professional connections.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\'s worse, I\'d heard that \\"co-op students today are like 10x engineers.\\" If that were true, what hope could little old me have?\\r\\n\\r\\nVero gave me an idea: \\"OK, maybe these companies will never hire you as a developer, but I keep seeing job postings for \'technical writers\' and that could be your way in. Once you\'re in, you can grow and learn and explore other things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"That\'s what you\'ve been doing your whole life with your avant-garde scores and their unusual instructions for performers, isn\'t it? Writing experimental music is like technical writing.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical writing\\r\\n\\r\\nVero was right. Unbeknownst to me, I\'d been writing technical documents all along, not only as a composer, but also as a professor, course designer, and researcher. Technical writing was indeed my main transferable skill. But how could I convince employers of that?\\r\\n\\r\\n### College\\r\\n\\r\\nVero and I decided that I needed to go back to school to get some formal training in technical writing and hopefully connect with people in the field. \\r\\n\\r\\nI applied to the one-year [technical writing program](https://www.algonquincollege.com/sat/program/technical-writer/) at [Algonquin College](https://www.algonquincollege.com/) around Labour Day 2023 and was admitted a week later. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a full-time student while Vero was at work from dawn to dusk was going to be logistically tricky, but thankfully my mother flew in from Curitiba to help us take care of the boys while I went to college.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing back to school was unexpected and surreal, but it was also fun. I enjoyed learning about technical writing and making new friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was also academically successful; I\'d spent so much of my life studying and teaching that I knew that the secret to being a good student wasn\'t intelligence or talent, but perseverance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost importantly, I had learned how to learn. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Notes\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, I\'d noticed that I retained information better when I took notes with pencil and paper during lectures. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot pen. *Pencil*. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo that\'s what I did at Algonquin. I wasn\'t trying to be quaint or quirky; I\'m aware that every college student in the 21st century takes their laptop to class. But laptops don\'t work for me: they\'re distracting, uncomfortable to type on, and using them doesn\'t help me remember concepts as much as writing does. Taking notes by hand forces me to slow down, focus, and make sure I understand everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Questions\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, I noticed that many of my classmates at Algonquin were shy and rarely asked questions in class. A totally different vibe from the spirited seminars I remembered from grad school. Maybe it was a Canadian thing, maybe it was a college thing, maybe they were playing video games on their laptops\u2014I don\'t know. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was younger, I used to think I was shy because I didn\'t like being around people very much. Now I know that\'s not the case. I tend to be self-effacing and sometimes agoraphobic, but shy? Not really. I\'m not at all embarrassed about speaking in public because I\'m proud of who I am and the convictions I have. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I put my foot in my mouth, I apologize and move on\u2014no big deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\'s why I ask lots of questions as a student. I don\'t mind manifesting my ignorance because the reward of clearing a doubt surpasses whatever social anxiety there may be. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Kindergarten\\r\\n\\r\\nMy note-taking and question-asking strategies paid off, and I got an A+ in every course.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I cruised through my technical writing program, Elias struggled in his first year of Kindergarten. He was kind, brilliant, and funny, but also opinionated, averse to changes in his routine, and stressed out by unmet expectations. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis personality meant that he could be indomitable when upset, although this rarely happened at home because I knew how to de-escalate his frustration.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, social settings demanded a type of flexibility (e.g., yielding to others, taking turns, changing plans) that Elias had yet to learn. Consequently, he often felt disgruntled at school and had difficulty regulating his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also cried a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart swelled for my young son. We\'d become extra close since the beginning of the year and it pained me to see him have such a hard time in school. I gave him extra love on the days his teachers reported he\'d made \\"bad choices,\\" and rewarded him with things he liked when he made \\"good choices.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nI also started volunteering at his school, going to his class once a week to play with him and his classmates and sing songs.\\r\\n\\r\\n## First year in Canada\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, I had a mix of feelings when we celebrated our first year in Canada: shattered dreams, uncertainty about my new career, gratitude for stability and the beautiful neighbourhood we got to live in. I was also putting on weight like I [hadn\'t in years](/my-story/12-elias.md#struggling-with-my-weight), which made me feel sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad we made the right choice by coming to Canada? Would we be happier if we\'d stayed in Chile?\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: This was straight up a d\xe9j\xe0 vu from [2020 in Curitiba](/my-story/14-from-amherst-to-curitiba.md#job-counselling)."}]}}')}}]);
