## Samuel's birth

When we made it to hospital, a security guard rushed Vero in a wheelchair to her delivery room while I parked the car. I made my way up to Vero's room soon thereafter and saw hospital staffers hooking her up to medical equipment and asking all sorts of questions. They told us that Vero was well dilated and too far along the labour process to have an epidural, and that she was going to deliver the baby without anesthetics.

### Hard delivery

Within minutes, the intervals between Vero's contractions reached a critical frequency and nurses and doctors swarmed around her and told her to push. 

It didn't take long. After a few pushes, Samuel was born, but there was no crying. He was lifeless like a rag doll and his skin was purple-ish. A doctor moved him to a corner of the delivery room while I kept repeating to myself, "Something's wrong, something's wrong, something's wrong." My hands were shaking and I began to rock my body and cry. This must have lasted no more than a minute. I was about to collapse when the doctor who had been tending to Samuel managed to resuscitate him.

Then they took him away. What happened?

I was relieved that Samuel had survived his traumatic birth, but I could not shake the thought that he may have endured permanent neurological damage. I started freaking out again when a nurse handed me a drink. 

They told me it was just orange juice. I think they might have spiked it with some benzodiazepine but could not disclose it. They must have been used to dealing with weak dads like me. Whatever the liquid was, I calmed down instantly after drinking it and asked Vero if she'd be OK with me going to check on Samuel in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

### NICU stay

The doctor put Samuel in an incubator, inserted an intravenous drip on a vein on his head, and connected him to respiratory support. I was overwhelmed with love and concern for him. He was tiny, even for preemies, and looked hurt and emaciated. 

The doctor told me that Samuel was stable and was going to keep getting better every day. I spent some more time there next to the incubator, then went back to Vero's room to report and rest.

#### Growth  

Samuel spent almost three weeks in the NICU. The hospital wanted to keep him there until he grew enough to fit safely and comfortably in a baby car seat. The doctor got Samuel off the ventilator a day after he was born, but the nurses kept tracking his oxygen level during his entire stay; I can still hear the machine beeping each time it dropped below 90% before going back to normal a few moments later.

Vero and I were so worried about his weight that we meticulously measured how many millilitres of milk she pumped each time, how many millilitres he drank, and how many grams he grew each time the nurses weighed him. We noticed that his growth was slow and irregular, but at least he was growing.

#### Waiting

Samuel's first week in the NICU coincided with spring break at the U of U, so I was able to be with him and Vero without interruptions. When classes and work resumed for me, my mother-in-law arrived in the US and filled in for me in the NICU, though I still visited the hospital whenever I could. 

When Samuel slept, I kept Vero company and read books. On Sunday evenings, I liked to watch Neil deGrasse Tyson's *Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey* in the hospital's breakroom, which premiered that year.

When we had to go home after visiting hours, Vero would spend her nights looking at pictures and videos we had taken of Samuel in her cellphone. The nurses had told her that doing that would help with her milk production and her emotional well-being.

## Finally home

After 18 days in the NICU, the hospital staff asked us to put Samuel in his car seat and leave him there for a while. They observed him and concluded that he was ready to go home. 

It was the beginning of spring, and we dressed Samuel with a cute teddy bear outfit when we first brought him home. I drove very, very slowly on our way back from hospital. When we arrived in our condo, we were all tired but relieved and thankful.

### Sleeping issues

As Samuel outgrew his bassinet and switched to a crib, he became fussy about sleeping. He had to be rocked for 10-30 minutes in the dark to the sound of white noise to fall asleep. Then, I'd look at his eyelids to figure out when he had entered rapid eye movement sleep; that was the sign that he could be transferred to his crib.

But I had to do it **very** carefully. Any sudden move, noise, or light, and Samuel would jolt awake, forcing me to repeat the whole process again. I learned to do a whole choreography that involved slowly sliding my arms from under his body and then waiting next to his crib for a few minutes to make sure he would not wake up when I tiptoed backward to the door of his room.

As far as nights were concerned, Vero and I had a plan. When Samuel woke up: 

1. I picked him up and brought him to Vero, who stayed in bed.
1. Vero breastfed him and changed his diaper.
1. I put him back to sleep in his crib.

I think it was a good division of labour, but it was brutal on both of us. 

### Mental health issues

After my mother-in-law and my mother went back to their respectives homes, our sleep deprivation intensified the effects of Vero's hormonal changes and her sense of isolation and triggered a post-partum depression that went undiagnosed and untreated. 

She felt trapped, abandoned, left behind. She watched her colleagues in Chile advance in their careers while she lost all hope in hers. She often cried, complained, and lashed out at me, despite my best efforts to ease her burden: I helped with Samuel; I did chores; I took our family on outings. But nothing seemed to have more than a temporary effect on her disposition. I was not able to make her laugh like before.

Her suffering got to me, and I began to break, too. No difficulty I had ever experienced before could compare to the agony I felt then. I've never fully recovered from that time, and I suspect that neither has Vero.

### Love above all

In spite of our hardships, I fell in love with Samuel more and more each day. 

I didn't know I was capable of loving so deeply and intensely. He imbued my life with purpose and adjusted my priorities. My studies, my career, my ego, nothing else seemed to matter too much in comparison to my son's (and my wife's) welfare and happiness.

## Back to the U of U

By the fall of 2014, Vero's diligent breastfeeding and mothering had helped Samuel become a healthy, happy, and plump baby boy with no apparent sequelae of his complicated birth. He was still small, but Samuel's pediatrician told us that this was not a problem per se. After all, I'm a short man myself.

I was afraid Vero would have a hard time when I went back to school, but a visit from her older sister and two close friends from Chiguayante in October propped her spirit. After they were gone, we had Thanksgiving and Christmas with my cousins and their families to look forward to. Fun things would happen again; we just had to be patient. 

I continued to work hard on my master's degree. I taught university courses in music theory, sight singing, and dictation to 1st- and 2nd-year music majors at the U of U. I wrote my thesis project and helped coordinate the logistics of two new music ensembles. 

I also applied to 10 different doctoral programs, all outside of Utah. I thought that my family needed a change of scenery in 2015.
