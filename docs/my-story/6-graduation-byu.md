## Back in Orem

In addition to my university courses, I had a lot to do in the fall of 2012:

- Polish my portfolio and resume
- Take the [Graduate Records Examination](https://www.ets.org/gre/test-takers.html)
- Apply to graduate programs in several universities
- Write my capstone project

But I should've stayed a little longer in Concepción. 

### Vero's graduation

I returned to the US in late July 2012 to prepare for my classes and to get everything in order for Vero to come after her convocation ceremony in mid-September. 

I regret doing it that way. I could've arranged an accommodation to miss the first few weeks of classes at BYU to attend Vero's graduation. Even in the worst case scenario, I could've survived a few bad marks.

This was my first big lapse of judgment as a husband. Being a good and loving husband has been a learning process for me. I've never been abusive or mean, but I wasn't very affectionate at that stage, and I didn't prioritize my wife like I should have.

### Salary negotiation

Shortly after I went back to work at [Classical 89](https://www.classical89.org/), a cousin of mine helped me land a job offer at the [MTC](https://provo.mtc.byu.edu/) to be a Portuguese-language tutor. I loved working at Classical 89 and didn't want to leave, but I also could not refuse work that paid 35% more than what I earned at the time. Especially now that there were two mouths to feed.

I went to see my boss at the radio station to hand in my notice. I was transparent with him and he asked me, "If we match what they'll pay you at the MTC, will you stay?" Part of me hoped for this outcome, but I honestly didn't think I'd be able to use my MTC job offer as leverage to negotiate a significant raise; I thought the station simply could not afford to pay me any more than they did. When my boss suggested the raise, I felt relieved and grateful, and I happily stayed at Classical 89 until my graduation.

### Vero's ESL classes

When Vero arrived in the US, her English was good but not yet fluent, so she enrolled in BYU's [English Language Center](https://elc.byu.edu/) (ELC) and studied English full-time from January-April 2013. During this period, her immigration status changed from F-2 (spouse of an international student) to F-1 (international student), which meant she could now obtain a Social Security Number and a driver's licence, and work part-time on campus like me.

In theory, ELC students could work any job on campus. In practice, the vast majority of them worked custodian jobs that required little to no communication skills, and that's what Vero did as well. She cleaned office spaces in the Wilkinson Center from 4-8 a.m. on weekdays before attending classes. It was a far cry from being a dental surgeon in Chile, but we could use the money and Vero was a good sport about it.

A lot of what I did at Classical 89 by that point was pre-recorded, so I arranged with my supervisor to work a very early shift like Vero. My voice sounded nice and deep at that time of day, too.

Waking up that early was hard, though. Both of us had attended [early-morning seminary](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/si/seminary?lang=eng) every day at 6 a.m. as teenagers, but our condo was located more than 15 km northwest of campus and we had to wake up at about 3:15 a.m. to shower, get ready for the day, and get to work on time. S

One thing made our commutes easier. As we drove down Canyon Rd and then 900 E in Provo and got closer and closer to the Wasatch Mountains, we often saw groups of white-tailed deer grazing on people's lawns and even on the campus greens. It was magical. They never dared coming down from the mountains after sunrise. 

I kept hoping we'd run into a cougar, which is BYU's mascot, either on our commutes or when we explored the trails in Rock Canyon, but we never did.

## One quarter century down

When I turned 25 in the spring of 2013, I'd been married for a year and a half and had been accepted to the master's program in [music composition at the University of Utah](https://music.utah.edu/students/programs-degrees.php#comp) (U of U). They offered me a full-tuition scholarship and a graduate assistantship that paid more I had ever earned—a low bar to clear, but nice anyway. 

I went on to graduate *cum laude* from BYU, and felt that I had become a seasoned radio producer after working at Classical 89 for nearly four years.

I no longer saw myself as a kid. I was an adult. Life was going according to plan, and I grew confident. I still felt underdeveloped as a composer, but I was hopeful I'd achieve the artistic maturity I sought in grad school.

So, Vero and I agreed: it was time for a baby.

### First pregnancy

Vero became pregnant with our first son, Samuel, when we were in Concepción, right before my master's started. I returned to the US before her to "prepare everything"—the excuse I used to leave Chile and selfishly resume "my life," again—while she had a stopover in Curitiba. We knew she'd been pregnant for about six weeks, so my mother took her for an ultrasound in Curitiba, and they heard Samuel's heartbeat for the first time.

We did not have health insurance in the US, so we signed up for prenatal care at a community health centre in Provo that offered sliding fee discounts for low-income people like us. The care Vero received at this clinic was not excellent and ultimately led to complications that caused Samuel to have a difficult premature birth.

### Year 1 at the U of U

Vero and I chose not to move when the U of U accepted my application. We continued to live in the Orem condo my parents owned so we could save rent money. Our family was growing, after all. We also saved on gas because the U gave me a public transit pass, and that's what I used to travel the 65 km each way to go to campus.

The course schedule of my master's was more spread out over the week than in my undergrad and my responsibilities as a grad assistant were flexible, so I didn't have to go to campus every day. When I did, Vero drove me to the Orem train station so I could take the [FrontRunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrontRunner) north to Murray Central, where I switched to the campus-bound [Red Line TRAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAX_(light_rail)#Lines_and_stations). It took me nearly two hours to go from home to campus or vice-versa.

I rarely drove myself to campus. It was twice as fast as public transit, but it left Vero stranded at home and was less comfortable and productive than riding the trains for me.

The FrontRunner had desks with eletrical outlets, and I could usually find one to sit at and play *Civilization V*, compose, or do some homework. When I switched to the TRAX—which were more like buses—I liked reading books on my Kindle and listening to Ricky Gervais's [podcasts and old Xfm episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais#Radio) with Stephen Merchant and Karl Pilkington. I got hooked on their brand of humour and consumed everything else I discovered by them, like the animated HBO show, *An Idiot Abroad*, and *Derek* on Netflix.

### "Painful to read"

I got along well with my composition instructor at the U of U, [Morris Rosenzweig](https://morrisrosenzweig.com/bio). He was incredibly talented and clear-minded, and had the personality of a lovable grouchy old man, always kvetching about this or that. He held me in high regard, higher than I deserved.

I wanted to understand what made him tick. I interviewed him about his creative process and his daily routine, and wrote a paper about him, which I then submitted to [*Perspectives of New Music*](https://www.perspectivesofnewmusic.org/). 

I had to become a published researcher if I were to succeed in academia, and at almost 26 years of age, I needed to do it sooner rather than later. It was intimidating to submit a paper to *Perspectives* because it was (and still is) the go-to academic journal in the field of contemporary music in the US. But I'd gotten an A in the paper in my research methods course, so I figure I had a chance. How bad could it be?

Pretty bad, actually. I got a scathing response from *Perspectives*. One reviewer wrote, and I paraphrase, "I hope it was less painful for Rosenzweig to sit through the interviews with this writer than it was for me to read this horrible paper."

I still have the email from *Perspectives* but I can't bring myself to open the attachment with the reviewers' comments, even after all these years. It was the lowest blow to my self-esteem to date. It's not like I didn't know rejection, either; rejection had been my daily bread as a missionary and a constant companion in my undergrad when I applied to competitions, new music festivals, and grad school programs. But this email from *Perspectives* was particularly scarring.[^1]

## Water breaking

One night in the winter of 2014, Vero started having frequent and powerful contractions. She was scared, but I assured her that they were [Braxton Hicks contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braxton_Hicks_contractions), and told her to go back to sleep. 

Then, her water broke. She was officially in labour.

It was a nightmare. The baby had been suffering from intrauterine growth restriction and, at 35 weeks of pregnancy, he was not ready to be born. It was happening too soon. 

We went down the three flights of stairs from our condo in quick spurts between Vero's contractions, got in our natural gas Honda Civic, and zoomed as fast as we could to the Utah Valley Hospital in Provo. It was the longest and loudest 15-minute car ride of my life.

[^1]: It's hard to write this and not feel a deep insecurity bubbling up from that trauma. I hope the love of the people I've written this for, my family and friends, will help them see past my shortcomings.
