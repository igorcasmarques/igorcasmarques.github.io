## What's a mission?

During that first year at BYU, I got a call to serve as a full-time missionary for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/) in New Jersey. I was to leave in May 2007.

The Church sends missionaries to places far from their homes and calls them to share the "[invite [people] to come unto Christ](https://www.comeuntochrist.org/)." In practice, this means missionaries spend most of their day-to-day finding people willing to listen to them so they can visit them in their homes, share a set of spiritual messages, and bring them to church on Sundays.

### Introversion

Being a missionary was uncomfortable to me. Knocking on random doors, stopping people on the street, feeling empathy for strangers, sharing my faith in the hopes that people would feel the way I did about it. None of these things came easy to me. A sense of religious obligation and the camaraderie of my fellow missionaries buoyed me up during those two years of near-constant rejection and derision.

Consequently, I wasn't a very successful missionary. I was obedient and hard-working, but had little to show for my efforts. I struggled to get people to attend church, and in two years, I only helped one person be baptized into the Church. They left a week later and never returned. 

As a missionary, I operated on the assumption that sharing my convictions was enough, but the truth is that effective missionaries leverage charisma and emotional appeal to get people to commit. Just like salespeople. 

And I'm no salesperson.

### Nomenclature

Missionaries work in companionships (usually pairs, but also trios) and count their time on the mission field in terms of *transfers*, i.e., periods of six weeks. 

Each companionship is assigned to work in an area with fixed geographical boundaries (we had detailed maps for them). At the end of each transfer, the mission's top leaders decide whether a missionary should stay in the area they are currently serving in or move to a new area. On average, missionaries spend 3-4 transfers in one area, where they cycle through a couple of companions.

I served in seven areas.

## First areas

Even though I was called to serve in English, my mission leaders placed me in Riverside when I arrived on the field so I could work with the area's large Portuguese-speaking population.

### Riverside

I didn't get along with my first companion. I felt sad and lonely that first transfer, especially at night. We lasted one transfer together. 

My next companion was on his last transfer. It was summer, he was ready to go home, and we didn't accomplish much of consequence either.

I suffered from sleep paralysis in Riverside. It happened twice. The first time was scary, but I realized what was happening and weathered it. The second time was much worse. I heard noises and saw figures. One of those figures was a pale man with a black beard and bloodshot eyes. He got close to me, face to face, and howled at me.

Some time later, I dreamed with Jesus Christ. He was much taller than me, and he hugged me warmly for a long time. I knew it was just a dream, but it made me feel better, and I haven't had sleep paralysis ever since.

### Burlington

After two transfers in Riverside, I was moved to nearby Burlington and placed in a trio with another Brazilian missionary. We were to keep working with the Portuguese-speaking people of the area. We worked hard and had a lot of fun, but we were not able to get a group of Brazilians to come to church consistently like we had been tasked to do.

In Burlington, I discovered that missionaries have their own folklore. Some of it was harmless fun, like silly traditions and superstitions. For instance, some missionaries kissed their right-hand knuckles and fist-bumped the roofs of their cars whenever they crossed an intersection with a yellow light. If they did this and the light didn't turn red until after they'd crossed the intersection, they'd have good luck with the ladies after the mission.

Some other aspects of missionary folklore were more pernicious. My wife has advised me against writing in detail about the sensationalistic, baseless stories some missionaries and members liked to spread. Suffice it to say that one could tell a person's sexual anxieties by the rumours they perpetuated.

I didn't participate in missionary folklore, harmless or otherwise. I thought it was all detrimental to the work we hoped to accomplish.

## Switch to Spanish

When I was in Burlington, my Mission President reached out to me:

"How's your Spanish, Elder Marques?," he asked me.

"It's OK, I guess. Spanish is similar enough to Portuguese that I can understand like 70%," I replied. "I don't know how to speak it, though."

"That's probably good enough. I will be transferring you to Freehold, where you will be a senior companion and serve in Spanish. Good luck."

### Freehold

My companion in Freehold was eccentric. Maybe he was neurodivergent, maybe he had a personality disorder, maybe he was just odd—hard to tell.

For example, during our daily language study in the morning, he chose to study Russian instead of Spanish, even though we never interacted with anyone who spoke Russian. When we visited people, he'd often refuse to speak, close his eyes, and go to sleep while I shared the messages. If it was narcolepsy, it was very capricious because it only happened in visits. 

One time he even caught and ate a house centipede just to be funny.

Regardless, the more I learned Spanish and interacted with Latin American immigrants, the more I became enamoured with the language, the people, and their cultures.

### New Brunswick

Congregations in the Church are called "wards" or "branches," depending on their size.

In Freehold, Spanish-speaking members of the Church were few and had to attend the English-language ward. Visitors felt alienated by the language barrier, and were not motivated to return. In New Brunswick, NJ, my next area, there *was* a Spanish-speaking branch. This gave us the support we needed to do our best work.

#### Receptivity

New Brunswick was not a particularly big area, so every day we whipped out our creasy Rand McNally maps and rode our bikes everywhere. We got to know the city intimately well and I fell in love with it, warts and all.

As missionaries, we observed that people in rougher neighbourhoods tended to be more receptive to us. While middle-class people generally ignored us or scorned us, working-class people were more likely to treat us decently, even when they weren't interested in what we had to say.

I wondered why poorer people treated us better. I've had cynics tell me it's because of ignorance, but I think that's a dehumanizing take. I saw a confluence of factors:

- They appreciated the hope and stability our family-oriented messages promised them.
- They'd been primed by life's unfairness to be more open to alternative paths to happiness, whereas middle-class families were more determined to find happiness in normalcy and conformity.
- They were more prone to hang out on the street and engage with people there—including us. 
- They felt connected to their blocks, streets, and neighbourhoods, and saw us as part of this social landscape.

#### Training

After a transfer in New Brunswick, my mission leaders assigned me to train a "greenie," i.e., to be the first companion of a brand-new missionary. 

Training is a big milestone for missionaries, and I took the task seriously. I got lucky and the new missionary, who was from Mexico but had been living in the US since the age of 5, was a great young man. He helped me become fluent in Spanish, and we became fast friends.

#### River of blood

My companion and I shared an apartment across Boyd Park on Route 18 with an English-speaking companionship. There was a friendly member of the English ward who lived a block away from us, so our flatmates visited him frequently. This member was notoriously generous, and gave the English-speaking missionaries a lot of food and clothing.

One evening, this member gave our flatmates kilograms upon kilograms of venison. They were not a hunter and we had no idea how they'd gotten the venison, but the English missionaries didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth and brought the meat back to our apartment. We fit what little we could in the freezer and left the rest sitting on the kitchen counter. 

Then, we went to bed. We were unsupervised 19- and 20-year-olds and did not see a single problem in our plan.

The next morning, I woke up to one of the missionaries yelling, 

"What in the world?! Guys, wake up! Come here! There's a river of blood!" 

He'd gone to the kitchen half-asleep in the morning and saw that the meat sitting on the counter had thawed and that **A LOT** of myoglobin had seeped through the packaging and pooled on the floor. 

It was a pain to clean and the kitchen reeked for a long time.

#### Hospital visit

Most people resented us when we knocked on their doors unannounced or stopped them on the street. We only did it because we felt it was important; nobody likes inconveniencing others and being rejected dozens of times a day. It's not like we were getting paid or anything.

Consequently, we were constantly looking for better ways to find people willing to have us over. One day, we decided to start calling members of our branch who hadn't been to church in a long time. Maybe they were ready to start attending church again and had family members or friends who'd be interested in hearing our messages.

We found out that a lady from our branch was in hospital, awaiting an important surgery. 

"Is it OK if we pay you a visit to give you a blessing?," we asked her over the phone. She agreed, and we visited her that same day. Her boyfriend barely tolerated our presence in the hospital room, but he warmed up to us as we continued to visit their family after she was discharged. 

The last I heard was that, soon after I left New Brunswick, they got married, he got baptized, and they were a happy family.

#### V-days

Back then, missionaries could only communicate with people outside of their areas by snail mail (with very few exceptions). In New Brunswick, I received an unexpected letter from a childhood friend, who'd moved away from Curitiba nearly a decade before. 

Her name was Verónica, but everyone called her Vero. Vero's letters were tender and entertaining, and I did my best to reply in kind.

When she sent me her picture, I was struck. She was drop-dead gorgeous.

I was developing feelings for her, but we were told to "lock our hearts" as missionaries so we could focus on the work. That was hard to do, what with our teenage hormones going off. 

So I made a decision. I would only read and reply to Vero's letters on Wednesdays, which was our mission's day off. Wednesdays were called *preparation days*, or "P-days" for short, but everybody knew that they were my special **V-days**.
