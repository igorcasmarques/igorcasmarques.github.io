## RDP

Life resumed quickly in Canada. 

A few days after we landed in the country, Samuel started attending a public school two blocks away from our condo, Vero got a full-time job for the first time since her [residency in 2012](/my-story/5-marriage.md#concepción), and I spent my days juggling Elias's care and my remote teaching job at [Red Deer Polytechnic](https://rdpolytech.ca/) (RDP).

Part of me felt optimistic about this part-time gig at RDP. It kept the momentum of my career going during a difficult international transition and was a way for me to get experience and connections and catalyze future opportunities in Canada. 

*I landed this job through sheer will, even before setting foot in the country. How much more does Canada have in store for me after I prove what I'm capable of?*

Deep down, however, I feared that RDP was my swan song. 

Most people with PhDs in music composition—or PhDs, period—don't actually work in academia. I got [lucky after graduation](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#whew), and then for four years I struggled through [immigration gauntlets](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#now-what-1) and a [global pandemic](/my-story/13-graduation-ub.md#a-faint-hope) to keep my academic career alive.

But my luck was running out.

## Unemployment

After arriving in Canada, I applied to a couple dozen jobs with an overhauled resume and curated cover letters. When I noticed that just submitting applications wasn't working, I tried sending follow-up messages to the hiring committees, cold emailing prospective colleagues, sending connection requests on LinkedIn to composers, conductors, performers. 

Nobody got back to me. This type of soul-crushing abasement was becoming the common denominator of my 30s.

Then, two or three months after my stint at RDP, I stopped fighting. I wasn't interested in a lifelong Sisyphean undertaking anymore. I just wanted peace.

### Vero's turn

While my career was falling apart, Vero's was blossoming. As a dental assistant, she proved to be such a valuable asset in her team that the scope of her responsibilities kept growing until she became the manager of her practice.

Vero's professional success put us in a socioeconomic stratum I'd call "comfortable working class." Our standards of living were low, we shared a 10-year-old clunker, rarely ate out, couldn't afford trips, and our children wore mostly hand-me-downs, but we were debt-free, we always made the rent, and we saved a little each month. 

### Isolation

I was happy to see Vero step up and provide for our family. However, I grieved for my career. I felt rudderless, lonely, misunderstood. I could no longer write music, and I no longer wanted to write music.

Contrary to popular belief, opening up to others doesn't really help when you're unemployed. Maybe some people find relief in venting, but there was no benefit for me in letting people know of my situation. In fact, sharing my frustration often backfired.

#### Do something—anything

When I moaned about the derailment of my career, people either implied I wasn't trying hard enough or advised me to swallow my pride and start from the bottom somewhere, like as an entry-level employee at a fast-food joint.[^1]

It's not that I had something against working at McDonald's. The issue was that it didn't make sense to get a job that earned less than what Vero made. 

Maybe when both boys started attending school full time, I could take up part-time shifts at a restaurant. But was that wise? Surely I had some transferable skills that could give me an edge in some field, right?

#### Be your own boss

There were also people who projected their unfulfilled entrepreneurial ambitions onto me. One person suggested that I "invent a revolutionary piano method for children and sell the textbooks," as if all it took to start a successful company was the vague outline of a good idea. 

With no safety net, starting a company was a risky bet with potentially catastrophic consequences. I'd have to slave away, accumulate debt, neglect my children, and possibly fracture my relationship with my wife.

Hard pass.

### Hunkering down

Sharing that I was unemployed with people got me plenty of questionable advice and absolutely no job leads or networking opportunities, so I mostly kept quiet. 

I also chose to stop applying to jobs and focus on self-improvement and redefining my career goals before jumping back in the job market. I could afford to do that because of Vero's support.

#### Beep, boop

In the summer, both Samuel and Elias started going to Spanish classes in the morning as part of the [International Languages Program](https://www.ocdsb.ca/continuing_education/international_languages_program) of the [Ottawa-Carleton District School Board](https://www.ocdsb.ca/). 

During the 2.5 hours they were away, I summoned all my strength to teach myself computer programming.

*If there's one universally transferable skill, it's gotta be coding.* 

I focused on web design and learned a little of Python, Django, YAML, JSON, AJAX, and PostgreSQL for backend work, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend. It was a hard slog, but I made progress every day.

#### Mudpuppy

After grasping the basics of programming logic, I began developing an app for Vero to keep track of her clinic's inventory. The more I learned, the more I applied what I learned, the more humbled I felt: 

- There is **so much** to learn that I'll probably always feel like an amateur.
- There is such a vast ecosystem of languages, programs, libraries, and communities that making programs is 1% original ideas and 99% synthesizing other people's work. 

Programming was also exciting and empowering.

As Vero's app became usable, I began to fantasize about its potential. Against my better judgment, I registered a new company, [Mudpuppy](https://www.obrpartner.mgcs.gov.on.ca/onbis/businessnames/viewInstance/view.pub?id=185e6c856f92f2744af3ee5b87a9ed2f9b5f457d273f08c7b86e683c2da07109&_timestamp=1017585962336548), with the intent of eventually commercializing the app.

### What if...

Mudpuppy gave me purpose, but it was only a pet project at this stage. To turn it into something serious, I first needed to acquire real-world experience in Ottawa's tech sector—which was unlikely to happen because I was an auto-didact with knowledge gaps and no professional connections.

What's worse, I'd heard that "co-op students today are like 10x engineers." If that were true, what hope could little old me have?

Vero gave me an idea: "OK, maybe these companies will never hire you as a developer, but I keep seeing job postings for 'technical writers' and that could be your way in. Once you're in, you can grow and learn and explore other things.

"That's what you've been doing your whole life with your avant-garde scores and their unusual instructions for performers, isn't it? Writing experimental music is like technical writing."

## Technical writing

Vero was right. Unbeknownst to me, I'd been writing technical documents all along, not only as a composer, but also as a professor, course designer, and researcher. Technical writing was indeed my main transferable skill. But how could I convince employers of that?

### College

Vero and I decided that I needed to go back to school to get some formal training in technical writing and hopefully connect with people in the field. 

I applied to the one-year [technical writing program](https://www.algonquincollege.com/sat/program/technical-writer/) at [Algonquin College](https://www.algonquincollege.com/) around Labour Day 2023 and was admitted a week later. 

Being a full-time student while Vero was at work from dawn to dusk was going to be logistically tricky, but thankfully my mother flew in from Curitiba to help us take care of the boys while I went to college.

Going back to school was unexpected and surreal, but it was also fun. I enjoyed learning about technical writing and making new friends.

I was also academically successful; I'd spent so much of my life studying and teaching that I knew that the secret to being a good student wasn't intelligence or talent, but perseverance.

Most importantly, I had learned how to learn. 

#### Notes

For instance, I'd noticed that I retained information better when I took notes with pencil and paper during lectures. 

Not pen. *Pencil*. 

So that's what I did at Algonquin. I wasn't trying to be quaint or quirky; I'm aware that every college student in the 21st century takes their laptop to class. But laptops don't work for me: they're distracting, uncomfortable to type on, and using them doesn't help me remember concepts as much as writing does. Taking notes by hand forces me to slow down, focus, and make sure I understand everything.

#### Questions

Additionally, I noticed that many of my classmates at Algonquin were shy and rarely asked questions in class. A totally different vibe from the spirited seminars I remembered from grad school. Maybe it was a Canadian thing, maybe it was a college thing, maybe they were playing video games on their laptops—I don't know. 

When I was younger, I used to think I was shy because I didn't like being around people very much. Now I know that's not the case. I tend to be self-effacing and sometimes agoraphobic, but shy? Not really. I'm not at all embarrassed about speaking in public because I'm proud of who I am and the convictions I have. 

If I put my foot in my mouth, I apologize and move on—no big deal.

That's why I ask lots of questions as a student. I don't mind manifesting my ignorance because the reward of clearing a doubt surpasses whatever social anxiety there may be. 

### Kindergarten

My note-taking and question-asking strategies paid off, and I got an A+ in every course.

While I cruised through my technical writing program, Elias struggled in his first year of Kindergarten. He was kind, brilliant, and funny, but also opinionated, averse to changes in his routine, and stressed out by unmet expectations. 

This personality meant that he could be indomitable when upset, although this rarely happened at home because I knew how to de-escalate his frustration.

However, social settings demanded a type of flexibility (e.g., yielding to others, taking turns, changing plans) that Elias had yet to learn. Consequently, he often felt disgruntled at school and had difficulty regulating his feelings.

He also cried a lot.

My heart swelled for my young son. We'd become extra close since the beginning of the year and it pained me to see him have such a hard time in school. I gave him extra love on the days his teachers reported he'd made "bad choices," and rewarded him with things he liked when he made "good choices." 

I also started volunteering at his school, going to his class once a week to play with him and his classmates and sing songs.

## First year in Canada

In December, I had a mix of feelings when we celebrated our first year in Canada: shattered dreams, uncertainty about my new career, gratitude for stability and the beautiful neighbourhood we got to live in. I was also putting on weight like I [hadn't in years](/my-story/12-elias.md#struggling-with-my-weight), which made me feel sad.

Had we made the right choice by coming to Canada? Would we be happier if we'd stayed in Chile?
